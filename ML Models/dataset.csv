"Why is the time travel logic different in marvels movies like x-men days of future past, deadpool2, avengers endgame all has time travel but different logic and different outcomes",0
This is very interesting and Halle Berry being in it is a bonus. I want to see her in more movies instead of JLO.,2

So thats Colin Farrell playing an overweight Robert Deniro.,0

Cool thanks for the long trailer...now I dont need to watch it haha.  Remember when they just showed you bits to get hype up and you had to see it to get the full story,0
"Was NOT expecting that. Figured this was some,  Taylor Swift type Flick:grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat:..This looks great.:thumbs_up:",2

Whats hollywoods obsession with struggling black woman protagonist sometimes,0

"I cant believe this is being directed by the same man who made Minari, it looks better than I expected.",2
Kinda wish Dylan OBrien returned to voiced BumbleBee but I can give Keegan a shot in this one.,1
It was Zendaya running after the bike,1
and... he actually kills him.  time to apply those terms,0

For everyone calling this a sequel....ITS NOT....this yet an unnecessary reboot...oye vey...,0

This is why Mr Tumnus is not supposed to leave Narnia!,1
 He need some milk! :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:,2
"I couldnt watch a film adaptation of this great book which Ive read many times. Therere the faces of the Buendias and Macondo deep within my imagination, I just cant let them go. I also have strong reservations about the motives and production of this series after the recent publication of a book Gabriel Garcia Marquez never wanted published. After reading an in depth analysis of, Until August Garcia Marquez was suffering from dementia which he knew compromised his writing abilities severely. This whole exercise is more about profits than anything else. Go and read One Hundred Years of Solitude, it is a truly memorable experience you should give yourself.",0
I was excited until I realized who the director was. Never watching this now unless Im on a long flight.,0
Logan looks much better in his yellow/blue suit. But even better sleeveless like he should be.So weird tho that Cassandra Nova is in this one.,2
"Came in hoping for another Witch or Heredity, but Im fine with a Shawshank bawl-fest, lol.",2
"Phew! So it is a horror movie. For a moment there, I thought it was going to be a sappy drama.",2

"Yeah, this is a remake of a 2022 version.  Both movies are given suspense and thrill factor",2
"Dont get compassionate, think about their victims.",0
Hardy gives me Marlon Brando vibes here and Im here for it,2
This book was a tough read but I am happy that I did it. Definitely a tragic family,1
"Sigh, no one likes PREQUELS and no one likes real looking talking animals!!",0
The literal chills I have from watching this trailer!!!  To hear the first sentence in the book as part of the teaser is simply AMAZING!!!,2
"The music choice for this trailer really was on-spot, the remix and editing. Well done!",2
" HAH, Liefelds Just Feet",1
So Dan Stevens is in this film but hes also in the new horror vampire film called Abigail :face_with_rolling_eyes::face_with_rolling_eyes:,1
So this is a rehash of original?....,0
The original is one of the stupidest films ever made.  I expect this one to double down on that and actually make you dumber for having viewed it.,0
Well see how it is I guess.... .,1
Finally!!!!,2
"For those who have not seen the original film on Shutter, it will leave a lasting impression.",2
I know this is technically a Deadpool 3 but marvel should start doing more duo movies,1
Any one noticed the Sanskrit text book that was shown in the opening shot what was it,1
All I see is the movie thats trying to hard to be something that its not the animation couldve been a lot better and they shouldve definitely chose better voice actors,0
Halle Berry is an awesome actress. I love all.her movies are very different and mysterious movie day one watch for me.,2
Calling it now that the daughter is the villan,1
This blows,0
Stupid movie. No desire to see it. Not sure why they are remaking this movie.,0
I have no idea what I just watched. Some somewhere around where ABBA music started it lost me.,0
Okay hallleeeee omg yes when is the release date :calendar: this looks like its gonna be :fire:,2
Ernie Hudson is channeled here. God bless the producers of this film and everyone involved.~:party_popper:He never gave up.,2
"Who are the people cutting these trailers? Neon is at the top of their trailer game, more so than A24. This looks sick, is the music just for the trailer or in the film?",2
Josh Hartnett was great as Ethan Chandler in Penny Dreadful. Had me wondering why he doesnt get more work. But Ive read it was intentional for life balance. Nice to see him in something new!! :movie_camera::popcorn:,2
"its not eddie murphy and martin laurences Life, but looks good",2
So this is exactly the original lion king story but instead of simba is mufasa. And will use the nostalgia trick to put emotions  on people. Floppity flop,0
Plot twist: the butcher got the money to attend this concert by being a serial killer,1
Wait...so where is all the sing singing. I saw a little dance dancing....,1
No doubt they will Hollywoodise the ending in this version,1
But the script shows Sanskrit???? Is not it. The novel is from Brazil? Wow Brazil India combo,1
"Im convinced M. Night is not from this world. His premises and characters are written from a perspective that has only observed and never experienced firsthand. Like hes always guessing what normal human interactions and situations are like. Hes always been like that, but his earlier films atleast had interesting subject matter, great actors who emoted very well, and even though it got weird, they still felt (somewhat) grounded in reality. Since The Happening released, his work has gradually gone off the rails, in terms of quality and longevity. Old was the last one I watched in full and while it was entertaining in a lets get drunk and make fun of this dumb movie way (atleast the first 3/4s), it made me feel like I lost brain cells. In short, M. Night movies are bad for your health and I think he is a negative force from out of this world who wants to degrade the intelligence of the species and plunge American cinema into an impoverished state of artistic destitution.",0
This is going to be amazingly dumb and I will love every second of it! Yes! No humans!,2
"Looks like it could be good but idk how I feel about it yet, need more context.",1
Are you guys going to make a series after the transformers one movie?,1

This years A24 Oscar juggernaut:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
"Im guessing the girl is actually the serial killer, and hes been dragged into things by her.  The guy at the concession says that theyve been told that the Butcher is going to be there.  So somebody has told the police. It cant be the daughter telling on him; if she had told police, she would have actually said its her father.  More likely, the father has told them about the Butcher being there.  There are so many other young girls there that it is hard to tell which young girl it is.  The guy being held on the phone is somewhat of a mystery.  Im guessing they are showing him because the father is worried about his safety; not because he is holding him.  Its also possible the daughter has an accomplice (another girl) and she is watching the guy on the phone.Also interesting that Hayley Mills (yes, the young girl from the Parent Trap years ago) plays the role of a Doctor in the movie.  Where two girls swiitched places with one another.  Wonder if this is an easter egg of some type.Or maybe the Butcher is actually Lady Raven, and they cant arrest her safely until everyone is out.  And/or she is threatening to kill people at the concert.",1
"Do not watch this film if you dont like unhappy, uncomfortable endings. Probably read the Wikipedia plot of the original before watching this film.",1
Hopefully Blue Ivy can act better than her mom.,1
The prequel of the sequel that nobody asked for,0
"Dont get me wrong, this looks cool and all but I thought we were getting a serious (pre) war drama about the rise and fall of Megatrons and Orions relationship. The unlikely duo of a revolutionary gladiator and the idealistic scholar wanting better for Cybertron but falling apart due to their different methods of making that dream happen. I wanted serious character and relationship study, heartache and angst and broken bonds, not some grand adventure between a group of twenty somethings :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face:",0
One of my friends at work told me that she would like to see Benedict cumberbatch in something dark and I showed her this trailer and said to her if this was dark enough for you and she said yes,2

"I would hate for a twist to be that this stadium is where Bruce Willis character in unbreakable worked at, and knew he would be there and helped the police to catch a serial killer. Obviously Bruce wouldnt be in this, but I could see this being in the m night universe.",0

"This series will be only a pale sketch of how great and terribly gigantic the original novel is, but it will be a pleasure to see all the adventures of the Buendía family, which begins with a death and will end with the birth of the mythological monster with a pigs tail, with which the story would close.

"I love Colman, hes too cool",2
Its still Colin in the eyes. Thats what makes it so brilliant. The voice/accent is even more brilliant than the prosthetics. He has created a full character. And Im all here for it.,2

"After what he did in Black Mirror, Im not surprised that he got this role.",1
He has to win something for this.,2
"Yayyy Im sure itll be great but can Ridley direct the next one, we just dont have that many years left with him and the franchise can always live on with someone he trusts why not get one more from the master himself",2

A rip off from Bird box and Quiet place with antiwhite cast. Hard pass! Garbage movie,0
"A24 might have another hit on its hands so weve had movies such as The Whale, Everything Everywhere All at Once and Moonlight all done very well at the Academy Awards and Im looking foreward to seeing Civil War what amazing production company theyve become in the years theyve been a production company",2

The movie is set in the 80s = stamp of success.,2
Looks like its based on alien isolation,1
I hope we see him with the mask on at least once,1
He wont win an Oscar for it though.,0

The tone seems a bit off base.,0
"Soooooooo hes just not gonna wear a mask, orrrrrr.....",0
"Wolverine has been f**ked over so badly in the previous movies and tbh, I never have liked Deadpool. At least now, Wolverine finally has the original yellow and black. Why? Apparently remains to be seen. I mean.. Sony should be in charge of MCU, they have made the best movies. not dismay.  and a haha funny joke with cocaine... disney nowadays is in charge of childabuse and drugs with a position of being a... I really do not know what. Do they even publish new Donald Duck cartoons?",0
"I have watched the original a while ago and it was really dark and haunting. Looking forward to seeing this version, James portrayal seems to be very fitting, i really love his work. He is so versatile.",2
Im a little tired of gory killings when it doesnt really have to be. What it need are thrills like the old Alien franchises.,0
"That sound, that pulse rifle, looks like a great mix between Alien and Aliens, Cinema is back, baby!",2

2 words......mind blowing......perfect example of how a trailer should be.:red_heart:,2
Yeah show us the whole movie,0
"I wish they didnt cast celebrities, but instead casted voice actors who were right for the role.",0
"Since they already revealed in the trailer that the main character is the villain, which is kinda of a plot twist. I hope there will be an even bigger plot twist that wasnt revealed. It would be pretty sick.",1
Cant turn a series on now without seeing Gays. Madness!,0
idk but horror movie with people of colors cast always been creative & good !!,2
1 minute trailer and 0 realismo mágico. Hope you guys do this right,1

Imagine if its revealed hes talking to The Batman,1
Why release this in June? Do they not care about the films success?,0
I dont care what its about…. I just wanna see Halle,2
"Of they theyre gonna have Halley crazy in this movie too.  Sad, but ever since she won an academy award, her roles have been limited.",1
"Lets be honest. As a Latin person Ive known of this novela almost all my life. Ive never expected to see it on the screen, much less in subtitles for the English audiences. The answer is simple. Hollywood. Thats why Im so happy there are streaming services today. Today, thanks to Netflix and other platforms, there are no more gatekeepers who decide which story should be told. Now, all the doors are open to see whatever you want on the screen. I am happy for Latin America, for Colombia and for the Spanish world. We are finally being noticed and known. Latin culture is so incredible and profound and the only thing we have been known for are drugs, cartels, corruption, dictatorships, etc. But behind that dirty surface there is a incredible and vibrant culture full of magic that fascinates every foreigner that dares to visit. This is just another way to get into the deep. I hope this time we see something of the magic realism that Gabo intended in his works.",2
"Twister is one of my FAVOURITE movies of all time, so of course Im seeing this in theaters BUT I dont like that they seem to be indulging the overpass myth,,,, people have died :grimacing_face:",0

Gonna feel weird cuz he wont have any of his unrealistic cartoonish gizmos- or a Batman. Could just pass as another gangster show,0

This is one of the best books Ive ever read. So captivating story and it really made me go deep into each character and feel the story rather than reading. I felt like I was witnessing the entire incidents. I read this many years ago and now after watching this trailer Im feeling to reread it. Currently Im reading Love in the time of cholera which is also so captivating and magnificent like One hundred years of solitude. Waiting for this series. :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,2

"Interesting. When I watched the original Danish one, (spoiler-ish)I was flabbergasted at why the visiting family endured all what was done to them. Then read up while researching that that was a comment on Danish culture; sometimes too polite to crazy extents for their own good. So I have no idea how it would translate to the American culture that is known to take no shit.",1
Good show other than all of the racial undertones,2

"This is just so good.  I saw it come up on the Netflix choices and was just staring at it, and then I thought, wait a minute, thats Benedict Cumberbatch!  Hes just such a good actor.  I thought it might be a childrens story, and its so much more also.   I also l love the Detective Ledroits character too.   Its very reflective of the times.  Eric the puppet is great.",2
I cant wait. I have watched this trailer so many times.,2

I feel like Ive already seen this. There was a white woman and her son in the movie that Im thinking of… anyone know it?,1

"Im a bit skeptical about what this new directors take on the franchise will be. The past films had a compelling blend of eerie philosophical themes and origination theory sci-fi elements that really resonated with fans. Im worried this new guys version will simply go for cheap thrills and a more generic spooky vibe, rather than capturing the deeper, more thought-provoking essence of the original. I hope Im proven wrong, but Im not holding my breath for this.",0

The twist will be that everyone at the concert is the killer.,1
The only movie Im looking forward to!!,2
Hunter Shafer and Sidney Sweeny are the horror heat of the moment. Absolute actress (Martin Scorsese Meme),2

Love you Halle berry not for me!:smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::face_with_monocle:,2
"I was hoping for a darker, grittier movie set in like foresty areas of the northeast U.S.A  like New York State, in a small country town. Where a kid goes missing and the parents are trying desperately to find them and theres this loan detective doing everything he or she can to find the kid. Loads of search teams going through the forest. K-9 search dogs coming up with nothing. Its a HUGE mystery. No one can figure it out. Its a real head scratcher, and conspiracy. Maybe make it a multiple season show on HBO MAX. It would be better if it was a true story. DOES ANYONE ON YOUTUBE KNOW OF ANY MOVIES OR SHOWS LIKE THIS?????GIVE ME AS MANY IDEAS AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE, I WOULD LOVE TO WATCH THIS. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE. :)",0

"Im Benny.........yes you are.....yes you are lol. Jeff Nichols in an interview said he cast Butler on first sight no audition. Butler walked into their meeting in a restaurant and at first sight Jeff said thats the guy. Thats Benny. He said he needed a guy that it would be believable that there is a love triangle between Comer, Hardy and Butler. Comer loves Butler as her husband and love interest and Hardy loves Benny as the guy who has his back, his brother from another mother. Nichols said he had to find a Benny that would be believable that Comer and Hardy would invest so much in. But Benny (Butler) isnt capable of giving back like that and there lies the crux of the movie. I can see by the trailer that the gang turns into criminal activities. Im guessing its Hardys character because Benny is supposed to be an empty vessel that absorbs the people around him. It will be interesting to see which character or characters are driving that change. The biker gangs of the 60s, 70s and 80s were outlaw gangs. I remember the real-life stories I heard about them growing up.",2
Please get Mark Mancina to score this film!!!!!!! It wont be the same without his music/themes from Twister.,1
So this is pretty much Jax and clay if they lived in the 60s,1

Highly recommend itediti just watched the whole trailer. and it looks painfully americanized.  the original is a psychological thriller. the remake looks generic af.,2
This looks fantastic. 2024 is gonna be GREAT,2
Is MGM gonna take their lion back or…,1
"Ive been on board with A24, ever since I had to explain im not gay because I loved Moonlight.  :face_with_tears_of_joy:It takes one hell of a team to make these classics.. Cinematography, tone, writing, music.. I just hope it all doesnt eventually get diluted..",2

Cinema is back babyyyyyyyy!,2
"So, like a weekend with my family.",1
Chillllsssss,2
"This is completely off topic but, Damn Hunter Schafer would be PERFECT for Stephanie Brown aka Spoiler aka Robin IV aka Batgirl IV. Shes pretty much a dead ringer for Steph and her personality is pretty much Steph. Seriously DC hire this girl, I for one would love to see more underrepresented members of the Batfamily in other media outside the comics.",2
Benedict Cumberbatch is so brilliant in it - new respect for him as an actor.,2

Sons Of Anarchy Vibes.,1
"for those vwho have watched it, please tell me the synopsis. Thank you",1
"Many people have expressed surprise that the original is still so beloved by people who were kids in the 90s. I think a big part of that is that on top of some really great character acting by several beloved actors, the original Twister was one of the first films ever to be released on DVD. It was often used in home theater retail spaces to sell people on big screen TVs and surround sound at home, which were also things, that had not been available before. Its testament to great sound design and VFX (for its time). The original had a heavy hand in changing how we see movies in the modern era. Im rooting for this film. I hope they wow us again.",2
"well, looks like they adhere to the formula....fantastic FX and little else (except to try and pay a whole lot of homage to the original which is a mistake since all that wasnt good in the first place...twins twins!!!! gimme a break....",0
"I absolutely love that M Nights last couple films have feautured his daughters beautiful singing and this time around shes playing an actual character, Lady Raven :red_heart:!!",2

"Looks good, Ill watch it because of Benedict, but I wish we could see him as Sherlock again...",2
He was AMAZING in Legion,2
I have a feeling that the person who is showned getting beat up on the streets is going to be Vincent. I got a feeling that he is going to get hurt in this.,1
Dr. Strange summons an IF known as Eric.,1
"Im glad to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, but there is also the thought that well have to say goodbye a second time to his character",2
The funny thing is that Hollywood always assumes that detectives dont have 30 more cases just as important.,0
cant wait to see the Sonic 3 trailer hit harder than la mufasa hitting the ground from scars betrayal,0
Who asked for this…?,0
"The original film is absolutely harrowing. I dont know if I loved it or hated it, but man did it stick with me",0
"This movie looks incredible, I am definitely going to see that in theaters.",2
"Outstanding news fans. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Ephesians 2:8 Jesus died on the cross for you, repent and believe.",2

Please be a horror movie please be a horror movie :red_heart::face_with_tears_of_joy:,2
Im fully invested for this  one ...,2
The daughter is the one who rats him.,0
Nothing new here. Retreads the same music. Hollywood is completely out of new ideas. Not a frame of this trailer seems fresh. Alien Isolation video game looks better!,0
This looks fantastic.  The close quarters horror and retro throwback vibes on the interior of the ship is something I really look forward to being brought back,2
Now we will see the perspective of the murderer escaping from the police and not the people escaping from the murderer,0
Giving stranger things vibe:smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:,2
Wooooooahhhh! This looks fantastic. Im getting big time mafia/mob/old skool NY hoods and Tony Soprano vibes here. Awesome!,2
"Looks good, I remember reading the book many years ago",2
"Please, stop making DC characters realistic, nobody wants realistic and realism in movies and TV shows anymore, we just want to go back to classic and traditional storytelling and classic and traditional characters and also Danny is better as The Penguin",0

The soundtack sounds so powerful,2
YEESSSSS!!!! Makes me want a Harley!!!,2
Thank god they showed us the entire plot in this Taylor trailer. Now i dont have to go and see it.,0
Whats the trailer song called?,1
"Oh man, make more movies where Optimus and Megatron are best buds, I want that to last longer than one movie before the inevitable",2
"Why did it take them so long to make another tornado movie ? If Helen hunt isnt in the movie, or cameo or referenced I wont watch . Also RIP bill paxton . They should have just abandon the twister concept and do a hurricane, typhoon , or cyclone movie .",0
CUCKOLD,1
Very nice and interesting,2
"Alexander Aja directing, this may have potential. High Tension was solid and Crawl was AMAZING! Was hoping for a Crawl 2, thought i heard it was in the works, but hopefully this ends up being something decent and not just generic junk",2
Did anyone notice the face imprinted on her neck at timestamp  minutes. Whats the meaning of this?,1
Movie trailers today are simply about showing the first 70% of the movie in 2 minutes. Plot and everything.,0
Feels interesting to have a crime drama film set with the killer as the protagonist,2
Tom Hardy Is Finest Performance,2
"Did anyone else find it odd that we never see Cassie once go to a job or claim income of any kind, or claim to have wealthy parents, but when she comes out about screwing the other guy, its Vincent that has to leave? Just sayin. Sure Vincent was bad for drinking and addictions, but still, he got done dirty in the end.",0
"Gross, just read the book",0
Why is this year and next year full of ugly ahhh remakes?,0
"Actually, the original still feels fresh.",2
Movie looks great - Finally Hollywood is making good movies again.  Im glad that they didnt Put a woman and make her a lesbian movie.  Finally a real movie.,2

Why do they show the whole fkin film in the trailers these days. And then they wonder why no ones going to the cinema?! :woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone::face_with_rolling_eyes:,0
As a theatre artist this is gonna make me sob isnt it…,2
Like if you recognised the ancient one.,1
"Sing Sing is the nickname for Ossining state penitentiary in NY state, fyi for those who dont know.",1
reminds me of HEAVY RAIN.,1
This looks cool. The Killer is the star.. Nice. I bet you any Odds. hes not the main killer..Shyamalan always have mulitple plots  in his movie... I dont trust him!.. lol,2
"Fuck yeah, more trans representation in horror!",2
Please no religious references!,0
Dads the killer,0
What are the odds I finished reading this book a day before the trailer drops,1
"ughhh another remake. Not a creative follow up, or corny sequel. A remake, same lines and everything lmao.",0

MNS movies are hit n miss with a lot of misses but this looks promising and its great to see Josh,2
"We need a huge biker classic to rival the mob classics of the past,the subject matter and historical material is not a problem but the longer the time passes the less real life figures are alive and well enough to share their stories! Cant wait too long Hollywood! Lets go!",2
calling it right now. The daughter is the killer and the dad who loves her tries to cover up for her and thats the big twist in the 3rd act of the movie. 4.18.2024 eat it shyamalan,1
Is that the Dr Strange Actor? Or the one Guy from Galaxy Guardian ?,1
Is that Cassandra X?!?,1
It looks good but Im sorry that Tom Hardy voice is so annoying and obviously fake:face_with_tears_of_joy:,0
Evans: Buzz LightyearPratt: Garfield and Mario Hemsworth: Optimus Prime I just realized that now all three MCU Chriss have voiced [non marvel] characters associated with 90s nostalgia.,1
"Excellent! Will be there at my seat to support this movie, the atmosphere and characters feel like the perfect mix to get scared.",2
" No , he is going drunk",0

"More reeves universe is all I need. So hyped, hope batman makes an appearance.",2
Why doesnt the tongueless kid write down what happened,0
I NEED IT IN BRAZIL LIKE NOW,2
Its a good Trailer the abba Song fits quite well. Another role of Benedict playing a drug addict :face_with_tears_of_joy:,2
Yea. This isnt going to be for me. I do enjoy that they are doing something that isnt on earth and doesnt have humans. But the humor of this and the origin story nonsense. I just dont have an urge to watch this or care.,0
I havent seen Gaby Hoffmann in a very long time,1
I already know their tesla is going to run out of charge when they try to get away,1
COLEMAN DOMINGO YESSSSSS LOVE THIS FOR HIM. HE WAS MADE FOR THIS ROLE. HATS OFF SIR!!!,2

Good one YouTube; we know thats not Colin Farrell under there. Fake trailer got us again.,1
This looks awesome!,2
I hope this twister movie is good as the First one was the best :smiling_face_with_sunglasses::smiling_face_with_sunglasses:,2
"The acting was good, and the monster was fun. But the screenwriter had too much ambition and wanted to tackle too many topics. I mention: a strained father-son relationship, an unsafe home environment, alcoholism, a psychotic delusion involving a monster, another completely separate missing person case, social issues in the New York subway, child trafficking, marital problems, an unfaithful mother, a rather improbable search in the subway with a drawn map, a homosexual relationship involving an inspector, and much more. It was too much, making the whole thing a bit confusing. The boy was also quite peculiar, with an exceptional talent for drawing, and the map he left behind was quite far-fetched.",1
when it happens!??! the trailler dont tell...,1
Is that a Gay movie or just normal male buddies,1
"Oh look Disney, its a leading white guy that can act!  Something you forgot exists.  Thank God for HBO.",2
Colin Farrell is incredible!,2
A24 and Domingo... Chefs kiss,2
the story looks like the child in time. Benedict did this before. He did everything over and over again except Sherlock. He doesnt wanna be Sherlock again this is makes me sad :(,0
"Hello, HumansNever let anyone tell you who you are. You should know and own who you are, take charge of your life.TERRANCE OUT",1
Omg. This is great. A classic.,2
This is one of my most favourite books. Really hope they do this story justice.,2
I wish I could unsee the bicycle scene. Damn trailers,0
Already sick of this Glenn dude,0
Austin Butler and Tom Hardy as buddies rival if not outmatch Deadpool and Wolverine in rizz; both now have official trailers for this summer but the Vandals biker clubs fights will be more realistic. Because. When its not the MCU and some people would rather crash than slow down it has to look like the laws of physics in real life have been followed.,2
nothing beats Sharknado :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:,2
Honestly The dumbest of all Transformers movies. With Bumblebee and Rise of the Beasts there was hope for the franchise. But this... I dont know what to say,0

¡ Wow ! From Argentina,2
"Danish (original) version is absolute perfect , because it shows Scandinavian naivety, fear of conflict and avoidance , this american means nothing",2
How tf you finna say coming soon !? Needed this yesterday,2
This looks absolutely fantastic!,2
Its like Horror movies the Only movies that get a budget. Tired of the wicked movies fr,0
Wait this is such a cool concept !! Its in the pov of the villain which is rare these days/ they usually want the audience to be guessing who the killer is.,2
ahh im gonna fall in love with spanish againn,2
Somebody said Halle Berry dont need to have anymore kids :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:,1

I feel like this is gonna be the Shawshank Redemption for this generation… looks good and cant wait to see it. Cant believe the trailer has me tearing up already :face_with_peeking_eye:,2
Teaser The Penguin Amazing :red_heart:,2
Is this another feminist pro trans piece? You know if you are a feminist you should be opposed to trans women because they are basically trying to take your rights from you imagine a trans woman deciding on womens rights that is what these movies promote little by little if you cant see it.,0
This was not needed wont watch it. Im sure many billy fans wont nether. There are a lot of tornadoes movies twister greatest of them. As I see a new corporate guy pretending to be a tornado cowboy. Not interested just a reboot. Im sure us old generations will not have a say. If we did this movie wouldnt have been made.  New gen enjoy. Ill stay loyal to my billy version.,0
Please dont let this be in her mind. Please dont let it be that guy in some kind of stupid disguise. Make it something freaky and weird.,0

Booooo I thought this was going to be a new movie not a remake!,0
The Batman better not waste him,1
This jawn just gave me chills :cold_face:,2
Why is the book in the trailer in Sanskrit when the story takes place in Columbia?,1

Im so excited to see this movie,2
Huge Jacked Man,1
No humans? Im in.,2
If I had a nickel for every time Benedict Cumberbatch played a distressed father whos lost a child I would have two nickels. Which is not much but its still weird that it happened twice.,1
Wheres John Oliver?,1
Went to Twister in the theater with my Dad when I was 11.  It was awesome.  Now Ill get to take my kids to the sequel.  Cant wait.,2
"Looks like a lot of fun.........,",2
Omg thats Samantha from Now and Then:hushed_face:,2
"Heres my viewpoint, It gives me the idea of a mother trying to protect her children from the world as long as she possibly can. Raising two black boys is hard. The world is evil and even though theyre not old enough to see the dangers for themselves, doesnt mean they dont exist.This looks like it will be a great movie. I honestly dont think Ive seen Halle in a movie that wasnt good.",1
This got me soaking wet!,2
strapping myself in for this one. 3000.,2
go go power transformers!,2
"Will this movie finally reveal the time Mufasa met with a white lion named Kimba but because the lion has a japanese accent,Mufasa hears Simba instead. They become cub buds until Kimba has to go back to his own franchise. In honor,Mufasa names his kid after Kimba. And so Simba the Lion was born.Truly magical story.",1
looks good. Just dont miss up the ending. Something simple like getting away in the crowd and the daughter found out that hes the killer or its the daughter and Josh Harnett is a split personality. Simple. Not hes an Space creature from mars. Simple.,2
MAJOR Sons of Anarchy vibes,1
" this actually looks like the June 21 2023 twin tornadoes in Akron, Colorado",1

7 years later Im glad we getting a alien movie,2

Still prefer the Arcadian,0
"Honestly I like this take, weve had lots of different storylines showing us the lives of some of these characters. This is just a more comedic and lighthearted take on it. I wanna watch it",2
"It looks not as a good movie, Im afraid.",0
"Ill always take a look when I see A24, lots of gems. Always a good watch",2

"Jesus loves you :red_heart: Please repent and turn to him and receive Salvation before its too late. The end times written about in the Bible are already happening in the world. Jesus is the son of God and he died for our sins on the cross and God raised him from the dead on the third day. Jesus is waiting for you with open arms but time is running out. Please repent and turn to him before it is too late. Accept Jesus into your heart and invite him to be Lord and saviour of your life and confess and believe that Jesus is Lord, that he died for your sins on the cross and that God raised him from the dead. Confess that you are a sinner in need of Gods Grace and ask God to forgive you for all your sins through Jesus.Jesus loves you. Nothing can compare to how he loves you. When he hung on that cross, he thought of you. As they tore open his back, he thought of your prayer time with him. As the thorns dug into his head, he thought of you spending time in the word of God. As the spears went into his side, he imagined embracing you in heaven.",2

"I feel like this was the cancel SONS prequel movie about JAXs  DAD JT & the Orginal 9 forming Sam Crow. Tom Hardy could have been Young Clay maybe JT & Butler is Clay instead , Along with Piney, Keith,  Bobby, wally, Whitney, Chico & Otto",1

"NEON is killing it this year! First they had Immaculate, and now Cuckoo! Hell yes! :raising_hands: Not to mention Euphoria stars Sydney Sweeney and Hunter Schafer starring in each respectively! This is already an awesome year for horror!",2

"In one regard you gotta admire  Disney,They keep on going no matter how many times they get it wrong,",0
Looks suitably chilling and  suffocatingly  claustrophobic....,2
Looks alright. Nothing unique about it so far.,2
Thank you A24 for saving cinema! Real movies with HEART!!,2

"I was looking forward to this regardless, but I was hoping the art style and soundtrack were slightly better. The fun dialogue is great though. This wont be on par with the 1986 movie, but Ill enjoy it still.",2
"My dad served 46 years, died in prison. This made me shed a tear. He didnt talk to me I only had to bury him but I hope he felt human. He did tax fraud, money laundering, white collar shit. Didnt hurt anyone but the system. I pray he could feel alive again",1
"Another version of Aracdian ? single parent & 2 kids, scavenge during the day but stay home at nights - that kind of theme",1

Since when did Facehuggers go Super Saiyan:face_with_raised_eyebrow: I feel like, for a thing that shouldnt have a need to evolve, its gone through quite the evolutionary changes since Aliens... Every movie since then, theyve gotten faster, smarter, and deadlier, while the actual Xenomorphs have remained the same.Hell, at this point, Id be more panicked by the facehuggers than the xenomorphs. Id take my chances with 3 Xenos than 1 Facehugger:man_shrugging_medium_skin_tone:",0
Well that Walking Daed show was clearly holding him back. Dude is out there winning awards and making amazing films now.,2
Sean San Jose!!!!!,2
Is this the making of Monster Inc.?,1
So Im gonna guess right now that the twist is obviously Josh Harnett is the Butcher guy but then we come to find out that his daughter either helps him or just knows about it and is ok with it.,1
This dude is so talented how he didnt received and Oscar after playing 7 different roles in split is beyond me,2
"Alien vs a bunch of Portland students in diversity politics - Their goal : Let more in, and fill their mail-in ballots.",1
Wrong cast for this movie. None of them look like bikers. Pretty cringe,0

Glad to see all these new movies coming out :face_holding_back_tears: its like the worlds been quiet without them,2
so borring same story every time not wonder always fail in the theaters!,0
Why do these production companies insist on releasing trailers without the release date advertised?? Like I genuinely dont understand. Its like advertising a fucking Big Mac without telling me what restaurant to go to. Youre leaving out the MOST important piece of information necessary. Am I supposed to just show up to the theater at my earliest convenience and just hope that its playing?,0
"Ready to see this. Looks classic already. Love Tom Hardy, great actor",2
Genuinely thought this was a new live action movie and not some teen slapstick comedy animated movie. I really hate when studios try to emulate the success of other animated movies (spider verse) with inferior versions of their own intellectual property.,0
"I would love to see the whole Ridley Scott universe come together in one film with Aliens, Predators, David, and Blade Runners going at it - hell I think Arnold should make a cameo in one of them as an A.I. version of the original man from original Predator.",2
So the guy that Josh Harnett has in his basement is the real killer and Josh Harnett just wants to protect his daughter...,1

They could have done so much better with this The story between Scar and Mufasa And why Scar has so much hate for him Why do they always ruin it :enraged_face:,0
I love this. I hope she continues to do more horror. Gothika is still one of my favorite movies.,2
Clancy Brown elevates everything hes in.,2

Never Let Me Go To That Quiet Place With My Bird Box.,1

Im very anxious to see Colin Farrel acting. He really looks like a penguin,0
James McAvoy gets jacked for his creepy roles,2

Sons of Anarchy: The movie.,1
but...why?,0
"Turning a classic Batman bad guy into a by-the-numbers mob boss film...ya, thats what we needed. Nothing in that teaser film looked interesting. If it didnt have the Batman connection no one would give it a second glance.",0
You know McAvoy is going to nail this role,2
"ah yes, A24 gonna make me cry in the theater again.",2
"This is the adaptation Ive been waiting for. I love this book above all others, I can not wait!",2
Imagine if this is connected to The Watchers,1
At least they didnt race swap everyone.,1
hes ded now so no1 cares,0
Remember folks! Those are herbal cigarette. Celebrities even opt for surgeries that clean there lungs of all the accumulated tar.,1
Please please please dont be another <old>,0
The effects look well-done but something about this seems meh. I was a kid when the original Twister came out and I was obsessed with it. I still love it to this day and the beautiful song Respect The Wind....The trailer looks okay I guess... it didnt excite me to be honest. I was just like...the tornadoes look good but they looked good in the original too.They call him The tornado Wrangler...Its giving Owen in Jurassic World but with tornados...:clown_face: Judging by how movies today are made for a new generation hell probably do a full Paul Bunyan and actually wrangle a tornado... :expressionless_face:I hope Helen Hunt makes a cameo and they do a little brief nod to Bill. It would be interesting if the girl was actually the daughter of those two.,2
D+  too  &  same days  release dates  too  please.    Or thanks Disneys..    all  HAILS  CATS & MEOWS!.,2
Okey so this is lowkey a promotion for Shyamalans daughter as a singer. Dope,2

Of course theres crybabies in the comments :face_with_tears_of_joy:,1
"I havent been a fan of the roles Halle has been offered in recent years.  But, THIS is the type of role that shes deserving of.  One of the best American actresses that has shown growth in her work throughout the years.  This is long overdue and I cant wait to see this.",2
M Night Shamalalama? *Michael Scott voice*But for real this looks like its going to be crazy !,2
"I was hoping for a more serious tone. This just seems too playful. However, us Transformers fans take it as it comes.",0
They really the missed out on ending the trailer with Aureliano closing his eyes in front of the firing squad and then opening his eyes to the banana Factory massacre happening in front of him.,0
The what now?,1
at first I was like stupid movie coming up with all these stupid rules like other movies but then it could be a twist as to why they are tied to a rope. Interesting...,2
I smell an Oscar this year for SING SING.,2
Hey netflix  can u make One Movie Or Show without a F in it ? Or is that to much of a challenge?,1
The saddest book that I have ever read.,0

i think i will just rewatch the original and save myself the disappointment.,0
audio mix for this trailer goes incredibly hard,2
The makeup looks so good! Typically an actor will just eat melted Hagen Daas for several months and just balloon out for the role but not with this.,2
"Wont watch it, but itll get nominated for an Oscar for sure",0
"Off topic - I need to find his facialist, those pores are non existent!",1

"Peeeeeerfect trailer. Music is peak, imagery is thrilling.",2
That one guy with the resting b*tch face makes me worried for the main character already LOL,1
"Happy to see finally an adaptation of such a classic, pity its Netflix :/",2
Hunter Schafer with her expressionistic acting looks all the more like a rebirth of young Milla Jovovich...,2
Finally lionsgate started making good movies,2
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have the original pulse rifle sound at least,1
The scene where Hunter extends & says Thats a a fucking weird way to put it! is a cool expression.,2
"Friendly advice: if you enjoyed this trailer and will watch the movie, then dont any more trailers. Its the only way studios will learn and you will enjoy the movie more with less preconceptions and expectations.",1
I love how NEON and A24 are making a mark by doing great indie films breaking into the mainstream.Putting the talent of Story-telling to entertain first. Instead of politics.,2
 is that Alioth?,1
So... kind of like a twist on Where the Wild Things Are in a way... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,1
NEONs trailers never disappointed,2
Ok i was a little worried about this movie but after this amazing trailer i am hyped out of my mind! Deadpool is my absolute favorite marvel character and I cant wait to see him and Logan on the big screen! This has the potential to be one of marvels best!,2
Best Batman villain show ever!!!!! :raising_hands_medium_skin_tone:,2
I hope we get a transformers one bumblebee figure (im still waiting on my bb movie voyager shockwave i pre-ordred from gamestop) :(,1

Just need reeves to be in here too,1
I never thought cobblepot would get his own stand alone movie but we all know how weak the penguin is and whatever he does in this Batman will defeat with ease,1
Reminds me of The Mother too with J. Lo mixed with Birdbox.,1
Burtons Batman characters were my fav,1
"Im going to add to the million comments urging anyone interested to watch the original first!!The differences in language is such a huge part of the creep factor that I cant believe they didnt at least have a bilingual family in this (although that could look bad too in hindsight)But, in the original, theres Dutch and Danish and they both speak English.. so a large part is IN ENGLISH (for the subtitle haters), but they speak their own languages to each other… it adds a whole nother layer of unease when you have no idea what theyre talking about right in front of you. Such a bad call, and it really bums me out, because McAvoy is a great actor.. I hope they dont Hollywood the ending. :frowning_face:",0
Gordon and Cameron got married!?!!?,1
We need Jeri the Xenomorph in one of these movies!,1
"So, Chris Hemsworth worked with Peter Cullen to develop a version of Orion Paxs voice.  Brian Tyree Henry is just himself",1

Anyone else think Penguin looks like Tony Soprano?,1
At this point A24 is the only company making good films.,2
the moment she asks him and his face reacts: Oscar,1
Glad to see Euphorias cast has been getting so many roles lately although a few have been getting all those roles before the show anyways like FTWDs Colman Domingo.,2
 is that ghost rider?,1
Child In Time INTENSIFIES,1
Anyone know who scored this trailer? Sounds beautiful,2
The humor and dialogue is like animated movies from 20 years ago lol,1
So Karen Hugher was right about the sing sing comment? Oop:face_with_open_mouth:,1
Should have cartoonize the faces for a better experience.,1
Pretty astonishing achievement to make the tornadoes look WORSE nearly 30 years later,0

Forgive me for not being too optimistic,0

mcavoy looks like young butler,1
"If you were to look at pictures of Alpha Trion from the 80s, from TFP, etc., and compare them to the Transformer in the cave, he looks very similar to Alpha Trion. There were also multiple Transformer bodies in the cave as well, and one of those bodies from when the group of 4 (Orion, D-16, Ariel, and B-127) first entered the cave had wings, that looked very similar to Onyx Primes wings from TFP.There are other things that I noticed in this trailer, but I dont really wanna name them all. Have a great day",1
Sorry but over the top acting from Tom.,0
I see the girl and I instantly think woke.,0
"This trailer looks amazing.  But given the name of the movie and the bird whos namesake is being used for this, I think one can probably put 2 and 2 together on what the plot twist will likely be.  Especially given the girl and her parents.",2

Just wish it wasnt about a group of young people. Wouldve liked to see a more experienced and cunning human opponent.,0
The tone is pretty off for a series about a war that lasts millions of years. Will be the worst TF origin story yet.,0
I need a new Predator movie just like the 1º one,1
So pretty much watch the whole movie on this trailer :face_with_tears_of_joy:thanks trailer park Boys,0

Why cant I watch a show on Netflix without some gay stuff,0
This looks sooooo good. Im excited to see it.,2

"How James hasnt won 100 oscars by now, Ill never know. Easily one of the best actors of our time",2

"Not a lot of Netflix movies hype me up anymore but this one surely does, this looks so intriguing :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:",2
The score/music sounds beautiful,2
this movie has already broke the cannon.  Im pretty sure Mufasa said or at least hinted in the original that his father was royalty as well.,0
Somebody needs to teach a class on creating trailers where you get an idea of the subject matter with some misdirection so you dont know 90% of the plot before watching.,0
I stopped watching it. The trailer was put together like that for a reason.,0
Plot twist: the killer is hunter schaffer. Its like that 2000s French horror  movie,1

"The whole premise with the alt modes makes no sense too, like, thats not something you earn but what you have inherently?

movie got a bunch of bad reviews on imdb,0

Gordon and Cameron are back !!,2
Hype!! I really like deadpool franchise!!,2
Gonna be a phycological thriller like shutter island where the entire movie didnt actually happen. Calling it now. Especially as a Netflix movie where they notoriously cop out on the endings of their movies,0
Seeing this opening night for sure.,2
Amazing Trailer on transformers one best ever,2
"It seems to be a remake of a Scandinavian thriller whose title Ive long forgotten. But if this movie had been good, I would have remembered it..... The ending of this story disappointed me, as did the actions of the main characters. I hope that in this movie at least the cool actors can overshadow the weak plot.",0
The tornadoes are far better actors than the human cast.,2
"I was so exited until I see from Shyamalan.. hate to be the hater here, but I dont want another disappointment. I rather skip this one, or at least read some reviews.",0

"Id  see so many people volunteer their time for inmates yoga classes , acting etc. I once asked this woman ever stop to think the child of the man killed your going to teach yoga to would like this? She looked at me like I cursed at her. Smdh. So many people are hurting over the wicked actions of these people. Yet they get more consideration than their victims and victims families. Make it make sense. Theres  a kid watching this trailer who knows the thug who took away his loved ones is getting a famous Hollywood actor to come see about  him. How do you  think that kid feels? I find this project pathetic.",0
this ones gonna break me i already know it,2

They just decided ok now its time to drop all the f bombs,1
Nothing teases about this teaser,0
28 years later....they look to have done the smart thing. Make as many things like the original. Massive credit to the cg crew. Looks far better than into the storm and looks to have used similar tricks as the de bont did in the original. Im so AMPED!!!,2
There better be enough black people in this :enraged_face:,0
"I think this is Colman Domingos first leading role. I could be wrong, though. But I do know he deserves much props as a quality actor. :trophy::trophy::trophy:",2
This movie looks messed up.,1

Low budget trash,0
Madonna in the trailer while she is giving concerts here in México?!?!?! thats gotta be a good omen I refuse to belive otherwise.,2
Hoping they have some practical suits enhanced with CGI instead of fully CGI.,1
They filmed part of this movie in my hometown I was driving around my city after picking up weed when cops had a certain street I needed to go down closed and blocked off from end to end but u could see past the roadblock signs they had the antique cars and older cop cars and they told me to turn around and I asked what was going on they said they were filming a movie and I looked it up and it says it was this movie had no clue tom hardy was in my city I can tell its the part where he says burn it down and is walking out the bar and looks at the cops and says theyre scared of us that was right here in my city Middletown Ohio even tho it says it takes place in Chicago u Can look it up once it comes out ima watch it and make tiktoks showing the spots irl once theres more footage of the full  scenes and can see the full settings of the movie look it up it says some was filed in Middletown and some in Hamilton and Hamilton is Middletowns rival town like when I was in highschool they were our schools number one rival :loudly_crying_face:,1

"I love the book and do not care about any adaptation of it. Because it will not be the adaptation. It will be fan fiction. Or something very loosly inspired by original. This book is really inpossible do adapt. Why? Because the original have almost no dialogues. Because it was written in a stile of Silmarrilion. Really i better reread original. Anyone who did not read it, but will decide to watch netflix adaptation.. you will not get the main jokes/ideas of book, you will not e en get the fague understanding of it",0

"If I had a nickel for everytime Benedict Cumberbatch played a father who lost a child, I would have two nickels, which isnt alot but its weird thats happened twice",0
"Can we all just appreciate the fact there still are studios/publishers like A24 who always put on fresh, original and  interesting movies that are actually thought provoking,  in the days of corporate bs and never-wanted sequels/reboots which are not made due to appreciation of the original but to be money grabs ?",2

"I am not sure if you can truly capture the greatness of Marquezs magnum opus on film,You must read the book to appreciate the magical realism that Marquez perfected.I still remember that sense of wonder that I felt while reading the novel for the first-time 45 years ago, I was 15 at that time.Most people dont read now.This is the reason our culture has become debase and mediocre.The reason why a lot of young people are easily swayed and uncritical in their thinking.They live lives without any foundation, simply following the latest hype and fashion.Marquezs seminal work and magnum opus, the most influential work in Hispanic literature and world literature has to be read to truly understand and experience its greatness.Read the novel, then reread it, then reread again.",2
Wait what?! This book is incredible. Looking forward to this,2

WTF?!!?  Who said they could use my name.,0
The donts are giving me goosebumps :face_with_tears_of_joy:,2

Colin Flanagan as  Pingu live to stream after the next ice age,1
"I have to admit I wasnt really digging this at first... but its kinda growing on me. The main problem is its overly kiddish tone kinda conflicts with the overtly serious tone recent Transformer adaptations had been going for... Still, this trailer on its own merits actually looks like this might be a fun film... and some context clues in the trailer suggest there still is quite a serious story within involving megatrons eventual turn.I feel alot of people including myself had been too harsh on this trailer.Anyone else getting Bionicle: legends of metru nui vibes from this?",2
Hes definitely locked in for Best Actor next year,2
Please tell me they find the kid okay.,1

This is a remake of the Danish movie with the same title but McAvoys portrayal in this trailer is a whole other level uncomfortable.,2
"Ngl, if this was 2d animated in the same quality as the original, my butt would have been in that seat, but its just more emotionless cgi.",0
"Ohhh, scary ABBA",1
"Holy shit that was bloody awkward, well in James.",2
"Oh god, I just had a feeling that the daughter will be a vampire so he needs to feed her. It would be just what Shyamalan would do and shouldnt. It would make juxtaposition to her being innocent k-pop girl and give leeway to the father on murdering (like say just like in Let The Right One In).Just.. make the premise be what it is with witty moments to solve problems and then the ending can be messy if it ends there. It doesnt need to be morally ok or it doesnt need to feel good, it can, if everything just fits like the pieces should. I hope for Josh Hartnett it isnt classic good M. Night trailer and then a let down or just being on goofy side. Since Josh has that Nicholas Hoult thriving when they are shady character with charisma attached to it (and he would need with all intense and purposes to be able to con his way thru situations where the charisma comes in). Also Hartnett was a lot miscast in past to romantic comedy, you could see Just from Sin Citys first 1min that he would work Great in a shady character (Lucky Number Slevin was sooomewhat) but only after Black Mirror was truly seen.",1
"I really thought the movie was just gonna be about a dad trying to save his daughter that was caught between the killer. Didnt expect the dad to be the killer. Then I saw this is Shyamalans work :face_with_tears_of_joy: If he gave that part out, I wonder what else he has cooking up in the movie.",2

Halle Berry? YES!!,2
 Is that Pym Falls from Old Man Logan???,1
"Ehhhh, I guess it looks entertaining. Ive been really excited for this but the trailer was disappointing for me. Looks very generic compared to the first. Not a fan of the male lead at all, jokes are already feeling dull, and the CGI looks about the same as the first if not worse. Im sure itll be fun but thats about it. A typical hollywood cash grab trying to reel people in with nostalgia. Not impressed one bit but ill be seeing it no doubt",0

Coleman Domingo feels like an actor that was held back from opportunity for a bit too long. We were missing out on his talent for far too long. Its wonderful seeing him thrive now. He seems to have so much to give to us as an audience. Im so excited for this project and whatever else he wants to put his energy into.,2

Universal going to need to change their name to Have no talent so just doing remakes and reboots...A little long but would rather type that shit out then waste my time on seeing more shit devoid of any soul because there is no originality in it...just fucking content for the sake of content to make money.,0

cant wait,2
"A 24 has gained quite the positive reputation for quality, in a very short period of time.

If the movie feels like the trailer then Im going to see it in a theater. I havent had any reason to go to one in a long time.,2
"There is actually an original Danish version of this movie, and its brutal, this is literally a remake of that movie. In the end they stone the couple, cut the kids tongue out and kidnap it. That is not their son. Theyve been doing this to other families:crying_face:",0
James McAvoy is swole AF!,2
"Transformers movie that focused on the transformers without humans ruining all epic scenes is like a dream come true:sparkles:Dang, I hope Monsterverse Godzilla did the same!",2
Wtf! I will stick with Twister. There is no need to see this version,0
Desperate for this,2
BRAVO FOR HIM. NOW I WOULD LOVES TO SEE HIM IN THIS.HES A GREAT ACTOR.I REALLY WANTA SEE HIM SPREAD HIS WING BEYOND THE MARVEL UNIVERSE.,2
"Reminds me so much of alien isolation like the retro futurism from isolation and the original films, the zero G scene, the tons of facehuggers, the flare throw, taking place on a space station and the environments etc., are all reminiscent of isolation. This is awesome!!",2
i hope this can live up to the original,2
Thank you marvel,2
this looks amazing,2
German accent on a villian takes it up a notch,1
 Im out,0
Colman Domingo has become one of my favorite actor ever since Euphoria  this man has been given some major good roles. Definitely adding this of my list for the movies I want to see this year loved me some good A24.,2
It seems like a great movie to watch!!,2
Its time to admit Disneys best years are long gone. No theyre just ruining their legacy trying to stay relevant.,0
"Love the music used for this trailer, where  can I find it please, I know its SOS by Abba but Im after this specific version.",2
Victor what have to you,1
I hope Halle berry has given tremendous performance..,2

That language in the beginning was Sanskrit! The mother of all Indian languages and the inspiration behind many European languages.,1
This also happened to my buddy Eric,1
I dont hate this?  The humor seems a bit cringe but its not offensive or anything.,1
Josh Harnett was great on the recent Black Mirror season,2

I wonder how theyll handle the pedophile part,1
Benedict all the way,2

This is crazy :face_with_open_mouth::face_screaming_in_fear:,2
OH mY GoD iTs WOkE tHeY Put A WoMan LeAd,1
"Never understood this book. All the magical realism stuff, and the dramarama happening in this town of Macondo... all over my head. Maybe it helps to be Latin American to appreciate it.",0
Hopefully they will provide a new song at the beginning. And new songs in the movie.,1
"Fill it, shut it,  forget it.. go bonkers",0
This is awesome!!!Now onto Charlies channel for breakdowns:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
"wow, another souless ripoff of a movie from the past, without an creative energy or attempt to be original.  You wonder why no one goes to the movies anymore?  because no one is actually making movies.",0
"Liefelds Just Feet business?  I usually find Deadpool stuff obnoxious, but thats a pretty good fourth wall break.",2
Thought this was an Ian Garry documentary at 1st:face_with_tears_of_joy:,1
The whole operation is run by Tony Lezuto… :),1
Marton Csokas is pretty awesome too. Hope his role is more pivotal than what the trailer alludes to. Im sold either way!,2
Is that Dr.strange?,1
Twist is hes not the villain,1
Sydney Sweeney :handshake_light_skin_tone: Hunter Schafer Being in horror movies distributed by NEON in 2024,1
This look good :thumbs_up_medium-dark_skin_tone: but everything be looking good then when I seee it on Netflix I be like this is bad 80% :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
The fact that Jodie can portray every role with ease… its amazing. And the accent.. wow.. anyone who has heard an audio of the woman she plays would understand how identical their accents are. Go get them tiger:face_with_tongue::red_heart:,2
I am dying to see this movie !!!!!!! My most anticipated movie of 2024!! This and Kevin Costners new western!,2
 White Girl Interrupted That old lady is my favorite,2
Based on a true story.,1
Im calling it now. Josh IS the killer.,1
Coulda did incredibles 3 smh,0

What a trailer! :two_hearts::fire:,2
Crap,0
"Plot twist, he gets away…",1
This shit has been on IMDb for like 10 years as untitled Tom Hardy biker project. And its finally here.,1
Can we talk about that score????? :red_heart:,2
I definitely want to see it! The concept sounds wild!,2
I cant wait to see this movie. After all my favorite actor is in it. Id see anything he is in,2
SOLVED:  THE BUTCHER is the flamboyant dancer [right-side of Lady Raven],1
Lets gooo looks exciting!,2
I was in this movie,1
Dances in joy*,2
THIS FILM IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF - THE SAME TITLED FILM Directed by Christian Tafdrup!! Which is absolutely BRILLIANT! on shudder. I think it came out a year ago. GO WATCH THE ORIGINAL! Its SUPER,0

Plot twist: Josh has an identical twin!,1
Tom Hardy after seeing John Wick movie..... ? Usual Revange thow..,1
How looooooong is it going to be?! Sheesh.... . Hehehe. Great book.,2
Im convinced there is no genre or character where Mr. Domingo would disappoint. NONE,2
A24 has nothing but hits! I mean they dont miss! :woman_gesturing_NO_medium-dark_skin_tone::woman_shrugging_medium-dark_skin_tone::hundred_points:,2
Its been a while since we got Aliens,1
I thought Lee van Cleef was long dead...?,1
dont think this typical Netflix look would do justice to the novel. I have always imagined OYOS being shot on analog film.,0
Imagine a Twister movie with a Hans Zimmer score!,1
"This is so refreshing. I saw two women, no blacks, and especially no black women, just mostly white males in this trailer...its like I saw a unicorn.:face_with_tears_of_joy:.",2
I think AB did some favors in the industry to make it there. Its like Hollywood telling us who the next famous actor is. Tom Hardy is the goat tho,2
A must watch,2
"Anyway, go see Sonic the Hedgehog 3 in theaters December 20th, 2024 that film is not yet rated.",1
Im definitely watching this it looks great and absolutely thrilling Hunter Schafer and Dan Stevens you both are legends in this film,2
I was sooo close to being an extra in this movie. Since the original that got me into storm chasing as a teenager. So happy to see severe weather back on the big screen :party_popper:,2
"I want more of loki series, and Marvel this is what I longing for",2
That Feige said is off limits :face_with_tears_of_joy:,2
Kidding season 3? but why did they recast jim? :confused_face:,0
Vincent the Father is a total Loser in this series. He really disgusts me! :enraged_face::face_with_symbols_on_mouth:,0
"In the right charcter and right voice, Tom Hardy can be scary as hell!",1
Looks pretty cool! But man it needs a 4K version! Gonna watch this on my big screen TV later and blast it through my sound system! Ya gotta see this big!!!!,2
SheeeeeesssshhhThats looking kinda fresh doe ngl frfr no kizzy,2
Alien Isolation was as good as it gets.,2
"This feels exactly like alien isolation, wich is great",2
"It actually looks scary, hmmm :thinking_face:",2
"Same vibes as the original,   it can go both ways, good or bad, depending on the story in my opinion. I hope it will be somewhat coherent with the last two movies, primarily by fixing some of the plot holes..",2
Feels like an A24 production at the beginning,1
Why not pick up from where Prometheus left?,0
Please put mcavoy and hartnett in a movie together.,1
chat is this real,1
"You did your thing, beloved. :smiling_face_with_tear:",2
"Ok, it looks not too shaby.",2
Some of this was filmed less than 10 min from my house lol,1
Production value looks good... at least on this trailer. But I have been duped before... cough Ahsoka,2
Shout out to Will Oldham  ~;^\~  \m/   !,2
"I wish they continue the last twos story, after The Covenant.",0
finally :red_heart:,2
"One of the craziest, interesting book Ive ever read. The story was absolutely ridiculous, but you just can stop reading it — you buy into the whole nonsense of the story. So far this trailer looks promising  :crossed_fingers:",2
How they are paying their bills though??,1
I really want this version of penguin to have his multi-purpose umbrella :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
CUCKOOLD,1
Glaucomfleckens Neurologist has been Benedict Cumberbatch all along?,1
This is what the Transformers movies should have been like from the beginning,2
Goosebumps shear chills up my spine,2
The book is awful. A confusing mess. Could make an interesting series though,1
We need lore not jump scares.,0
"So, it is a goofy comedy? I was hoping for something more like the War for Cybertron video game. I will still watch it, but I hope they do not ruin it like they did with that Teen Age Mutant Nija Turtle movie that came out last year. That was terrible.",2
Way to bury the lead,0
So he is THE BUTCHER?,1
"I feel like these trailers shows waaaaay too much. Had to stop it after the 2 minutes mark, or else I feel like Im watching the whole damn thing!",0
"This dude: Im not giving up on our boy! Im going to dress up as a monster he drew to do it!His wife: :neutral_face:Their boy, locked away somewhere without a TV anyway: :face_with_crossed-out_eyes:",1
The black dude is involved.,1
"Thatd be cool if, in the end, aliens show up.",2
 she got a point =))) its almost like a motive behind his line =)))) like what is he implying =))),2
"I have been wondering whether this book was ever made into a movie and I have been thinking that it would have to be a series or a very long movie. I have been thinking about how difficult it would be to adapt well. After a failed attempt, I am reading it in Spanish right now. I am not a native speaker. I´m level B2, so it´s very difficult for me. I read 1 chapter per month. I am on chapter 16, so I have been reading it for 16 months now. I am in a book club with 3 other people and we discuss it. One has degrees in Latin American and Spanish literature (as do I), but he explains the book. I did my undergrad thesis on Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Crónica de una muerte anunciada) by Márquez. That´s when I fell in love with the author. My heard jumped with excitement when I saw the trailer. It almost brought me to tears! I can´t wait for it to debut. I will watch it in Spanish with Spanish subtitles to  help me improve my language skills. This is an important book for everyone to read because it explores the human condition and the history of Latin America through the microcosm of the fictional Macondo.",1
Looks like a greatest hits redux to me. Blecch.,0
Thank you Netflix :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,2
R.I.P Bill Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman,1
I wonder if there are going to be any flashbacks to when the husband and wife met there story is that they met at a art college. And I found out that Benedict cumberbatch has a stunt double in this,1
This is so awesome,2
 This will be the most rewatched part of the teaser.,2
To say Netflix will be under pressure to not f--k this up would be a massive understatement.,0
Cant believe they used actual footage of a Tesla with autopilot engaged @,1
Finally a trailer that doesnt start with TRAILER. STARTS. NOW. and big booming sounds and flashing. As if I needed reminding of what I clicked on two seconds ago. So insultingly dumb.,2
This is a scary movie in a long time. This guys McAvoy doesnt disapoint.,0
I dont know if I have the strenght to see this one. I just dont know.,1
That rope is your life line never let it go,1
"i think Comic Book movies are lame, I just cant believe thats Colin Farrell lol",0
"Nothing scares me anymore, except maybe a republican rally.",1
That last scene made me literally nauseous. Im not watching this movie. Probably a great horror. But too much for me.,0
"They got the cigar, whats only left is the monocle, and that would be the Penguin, the only and one Oswald Cobblepot, and Colin would be lto the Penguin what Heath Ledger is to the Joker",2
Rex Calabrese is Selina Kyle aka the Catwomans father,1
"Finally, Wolverine we deserved. what took you so long to wear your only suit.",2
Its time to see more James McAvoy playing some military movies as a hero please. He has the build and the look to play special forces.,2
"Its a blessing for the TRANSFORMERS PRIME Fans, All TFP fans already know about the most of the characters and it would be fun to watch them back again with another storyline.",2
Making the world a brighter place.,1
Tom Hardy is one hell of actor!,2
Halle looking scary lol on some gothica stuff.,1
"So, This is Transformers mixed with X-Men: First Class, Ninja Turtles and Ferris Bueller-like Teenage Comedy.IM IN!!!",2
The plot itself is very intriguing but having Benedict involved takes it to a different level. Definitely will be watching it,2
Whos Chris Pratt playing?,1
"I hope it is not the same movie, but with new actors...",1
"Will it tell the origin of aliens, like where they came from?",1
Another woke series from netflix. I am sick of this brainwashing ungodly nonsense. Netflix getting cancelled.,0
Looks fine except for the main character pretending to be female.,0
This actually looks really good.,2
Looks lame.. same premise as part 1.. What ever happened to originality Im Hollywood?:crying_face:,0
"Nope. When that boy opened his mouth, I went tharn and stopped the preview",0
why trash video quality?,0
It looks very much like Twister but with a less engaging and charming cast to pull it through the innate stupidity of the concept.They could make more money remastering Twister for Imax and releasing that for a couple of weeks.This is going to tank HARD,0
This one is going to make me ugly cry. Im there.,2
Ive already seen this movie and Im not sure how. I assume this is a remake.,1
Oh yeah this is a day one :index_pointing_up_medium-dark_skin_tone:,2
Was that ant mans suit and Dr Stranges portal they jumped through? I think its all coming to convergence point in this movie,1
Lets go cant wait :red_heart::face_with_tears_of_joy::party_popper::crying_face::face_with_open_mouth::grinning_face_with_sweat:,2
"At Halles age, she really has no business still being the sexiest woman on the planet. But here we are :man_shrugging:",2
This is similar to the movie Tethered,1
Aw shit. Here we go again,0
Really interesting trailer,2
Netflix out to ruin another great masterpiece,0
"What sort of dumbarse puts a stock truck in the way of a Twister?? FFS, at least hire the T.I.V.2 from Sean Casey!",0
"I truly truly HOPE that this movie will convey the atmosphere of the ORIGINAL movie Alien (1979) and NOT any of the sequels. I want something that portrays the Alien as and incredibly creepy and horrifying monster of the dark, just like the first movie or Alien Isolation did, and NOT some all-out action shooter movie..",1
I havent seen this guy since that vanpire movie and now after he was in Oppenhemier he is getting more credit  ....,1
Who asked for this,0
Aziz bhai laughing in corner:face_with_tears_of_joy:Hail sccopcast:moai:,2
How is it possible that CGI in 2024 looks worse than 1998,0
Deadpool finally have a regen buddy,1
"Wow, another comic book movie.  Im thrilled beyond words, really...",2
Wtf is this even about? It looks Great but i have no clue whatsoever,2
"How are they eeeeeever going to do this? There are so many storylines in the book and things go so rapid, very curious how it will translate to film",1
Should have made a movie about scar this movie will unfortunately flop :grinning_face_with_sweat:,0
Coleman Domingo Best Actor 2025 Oscars. Book it,2
Look Great,2
Am I tripping or is that X-23 from X-Men 2 and Azazel from X-Men First Class?! @,1
It was the Dad.,1
I hope its a good movie because anytime a trailer comes out and it shows you a bit of the movie its always amazing!!,2
"Well, theyve definitely established the right look and the proper tone. Gotta give them that much.",2
Im not supporting this gay actor.,0
I think Josh is going to be great in this.,2
The vendor knows this big police ambush LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOL Ill pass,0
"This copy of the first Alien yes, but the 3rd film in Scotts trilogy no?You people are weird.",0
"Finally.  I mean, Josh Hartnett basically auditioned for this role back in Sin City 1.",2
"Feel like M. Knight is on a redemption path lately, definitely will be there for this one! Its giving You S1 a bit.",2
"The change away from iconic voices, or at least just Optimuss voice, ruins it for me. Just looks dumb. But I guess its for kids, so whatever.",0
"Are there any black, transgenders body positive in actors  in the cast?",1
"... Why? Twister didnt need a sequel remake or whatever, just leave it there ffs.",0
"This movie doesnt look that good, but James MacAvoy looks good with a dad bod. (Just about the only guy who can pull it off)",0
Please read the book.,1
Skeptical,1
I really liked minari and i hope this be a great movie. Maybe even a contender for best picture,2
A gripping story of how Qui-gon Jin taught a lion how to project his force ghost.,1
Wow... Dude Pride Rock!,1
Thus begins the LKCU (Lion King Cinematic Universe),1
"Well thats not cannon (even as a post created prequel), but it looks entertaining.",2
"Enjoyed Twister, but it was a silly Hollywood fantasy. Theyre going back to the well, hopefully they get a cast that can make it as amusing as the last one. Tornadoes are no joke. Grew up in Tornado Alley. So did Paxton, he had the background to play it funny but serious. They shoulda got Pitt. He knows it too.",2
Shouldve let the shoulder pads on,1
 The saviours of the MCU are here :fire::fire:,2
"I keep telling myself I need to read this book, but Im a sci-fi horror or true event survival guy.",1
"Someone needs to do a metal cover of SOS by Abba.  Its years before my time, but it would work.",2
National Geographic?,1
Whats the name of the song at the beginning?,1
This was an epic series. Definitely enjoyed the script.,2
Dan Stevens F*n HOT asf ..specially in that movie  GUESS,2
"The book is one of the best pieces of art I have ever read, hopefully they do justice to it..",2
Well Ridley Scott is part of so it may be worth a watch,2
" what an execution wow !!! I see more horror films stepping up the game ,looking promising!",2
Marvel is feeling the heat,2
Book still on my shelf. After all these years. May need to read it again now. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
I love Benedict Cumberbatch but this is not for me. No thank you,0
So hes literally just playing Sherlock Holmes again but as a father looking for his son... lol. A shame hell never play Sherlock again.,1
Garcia Marquez didnt want his book turned into a movie or series. Netflix is worse than any cartel.,0
Damn what a trailer :crying_face::crying_face:,2
"James McAvoy looks like hes well & truly Ripped in this movie! Couple of pretty decent Arm Cannons & one hellve Six Pack goin on there as well! Oh wow, I gots me a bit of a sweat on now, phew! :kissing_face::dashing_away: Nope, I actually just melted altogether instead. :melting_face: So, less of a drippy me & more like a puddle of me!  Movie looks quite good too! :grinning_face_with_sweat:",2
This movie already looks shitty,0
I was just hoping and praying it wasnt an m night shamala movie I hate his movies,0
Halle Berry Halle Berry Halle Berry Halle Berry She fine,2
Nah. I refuse to believe a reboot of a reboot of a reboot of a reboot of a reboot is gonna be any good.,0
Is this a movie?,1
Read the book and Im glad theres also a movie !,2
Ok so  theyre experimenting on people. And one went wrong. Or she has already went through it and is now seeing her shadow side come to the surface. :woman_shrugging_medium_skin_tone:,1
We need to watch it in 0.5 x :confused_face:,1
this is dumb,0
"It just looks like its filled with passion, dedication, and that they werent acting. These people were those characters, and I cant wait to see what happens.",2
Twister my childhood memory :face_with_open_mouth:,1
We could have had another 2D lion king masterpiece. Its almost like these companies are allergic to money. Disney do better plz.we know you can.,0
A remake was a bad choice. They would have been better off making a true sequel. Like fast-forward 5-10 years in the Twister universe to where they have more advanced chasing tools and take some inspiration from like Reed Timmer and that armored car they built,0
"Idk why everyone is hating, it looks Incredible. And you guys hate on this but not games like tomb raider 1-2-3 remastered? Cool.",2
Why Tom Hardy looks so believable in this to me?,1
This guy makes smart movies for stupid people,2
Cant wait for this one.,2
What a lot of people dont get is that The Batman and The Penguin really are the closest thing weve come to a real life vigilante detective and a villain portrayed the way they are.,2
"Omg whaaaaatt, Ive been listening to Saleka for years now. I love how her dad is so supportive of her work, cant wait to see this now!! :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:",2
She looks the character she played in Raising Isaiah! So happy to see Halle Berry back on screen!!! :popcorn: :movie_camera:,2
Cant wait!!,2
"This movie is going to break my goddamn heart, isnt it?",2
We asked for a war of cybertron movie and instead they give us this with Optimus doing a solid Chris Hemsworth impression,0
"Fear The Walking Deads Strand is starting to show up in everything. Ive seen him in Euphoria, the Candyman requel & at this point no matter what movie or show hes in … Ill always see him as Strand. But props to Colman Domingo for getting so much work all of a sudden.",2
Sanskrit the lyrical language... Wonder to find it in just few seconds... Waiting for the Magical journey,2
"I hear that song, I cant not hear Windows 95 Sucks.  :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:",1
This could have been great but all I can hear is Thor pretending to be Optimus prime and it just sounds wrong,0
Just like the remake. It looks fantastic visually. But is gonna have about as much substance as a carboard cake.,0
Lol took them long enough to release this:face_with_tears_of_joy:cnt wait tho!,2
Theyre making a mockery of Transformers.,0
I hope David comes back.,1
I hope this story wont get NETFLIXED...,0
You know if a movie has a famous actress with no makeup on its about to go down,2
"No,thank you!trailer is enough:woman_shrugging:",2
"I hope we see sentinel or zeta prime, dion, and or ultra magnus. also I anybody has any issues with continuity its an obscure fact that when cybertron or unicron gets destroyed it usually create massive ripples in space time leading to plot holes, retcons, and even alternate timelines being formed",1
this is literally Power Rangers but as Transformers :face_with_tears_of_joy:,1
Officially run out of ideas have we Hollywood?,0
Ok thats a lot of facehuggers,1
No thanks.,0
Dare I say Austin Butler is our generations James Dean.  Did I spy Norman Reedus here too!? Hell yeah. Ride on.,2
"Oh yes, this is fuckin it.",2
This movie definitely didnt need a remake. Looks like a bad imitation of what the original wanted to accomplish.,0
 He tripped and fell in the back of McDonalds! :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:,1
This looks cool,2
I love Gaby Hoffmann!,2
Every time Halle has kids in a movie something bad happens :face_with_tears_of_joy:,1
Batman is showing up at least once or twice,1
A very versatile actor.,2
Its a story of many stories,1

"Maybe Id be interested, if it was in the original animation",0
I read this book back in junior high or high school. I havent thought about it over 3 decades.,1
"Looks fantastic, cant wait to watch!",2
Year Zero,1
JOSH HARTNETT IS BACK IN A LEADING ROLE!!!!!!,2
this look like a high budget movie wtf,2
This is animated :crying_face:,0
Things that only happen to liberal families.,1
Epic. Thats what you get when you have directors who have read the material themselves.,2
I cried for an hour when I finished the book. I cant believe this is happening. I wanna cry again.,0
I will be truly shocked if they can convey this story on the big screen! its such a winding piece of literature,0
"Didnt expect that to be soo childish, if the targeted audience 0 to 12 years old kids thats okey but this movie huge miss for me.",0
How dare you touch this masterpiece? f you netflix,0
This has got to be a remake of Sidehackers...,1
My favorite line is the YEAH deadpool screams out of pure satisfaction.  LFG,2
I think that the mom is bugging or have mental issues. She may think that she is protecting her children but is causing them great harm. Thats what I think the movie is gone gonna show,1
I AM SO EXCITED,2
What complete disrespect for bill Paxton pure cash grab looks terrible,0

Lets f**** go!,2
now THIS is how you make a trailer dude,2
lmao:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:Hunter Schafernope bye,0
This is the most wholesome transformers movie Ive seen,2
Ive always thought A24 films are hit or miss but this one feels like its going to leave me wrecked by the end.,2
If youve read the book youd know not to trust the daughter.,1
Wow!!! This looks really good.,2
I really hope ridley scott has as little to do with this movie as possible. It is clear from Prometheus and Covenant that he has no idea what made Alien 1 and 2 so amazing.,1
I literally couldnt remember Josh Hartnetts name. Damn me and him are getting old. Loved him in The Faculty.,2
it seems to be based on alien isolation .,1
And Fassbender is not in this correct. Theyre doing away with the prequel crap.,0
"Netflix bumbles again..usual it seems. This could have almost been a family movie which not only Entertained folks but just maybe couldve  taught us something and had a moral lesson to it. Instead we standard ratings / warnings at the kick off which state substance abuse, smoking and language. Smoking? I mean god forbid your kids might see a cigar...but dudes kissing, a male teen prostitute doing a favor in an alley before being beaten to death? Plenty of simply unnecessary sexual descriptions and images which just ruin the movie. Netflix crapped in the punch bowl yet again.",0
Why every trailer from the last couple of years has to include a classic rock song?,0
Havent we watched this already?,0
"The trailer did a great job. Wasnt over informative, looks quality & the last sense was behind creepy. Im in",2
Why remake a great film that only came out in 2022? The scenes from this trailer are direct mimics of scenes from the original movie. Incredibly lazy film making in my opinion. The original had a great cast and set the tone for potentially great extensions of the story. James is an excellent actor and wouldve been better placed in a well written sequel.,0
This trailer f*?!ing rocks!!!!,2
I cant wait to see this movie this is movie I think Im gonna watch it for the rest of my life,2
Excited for this creature feature!,2
So very ready for a story like this :red_heart: *grabs Kleenex,2
show is good i liked it its about watch to find out,2
This is worth seeing!! Im hyped!!,2
Thank god  theres a remake,2
Please be TV-MA,1
The twist is…there is no twist,1
Just keep swinging Lionsgate.  You cant get a hit if you dont swing.,1
"Josh Hartnett is back where he belongs, on top!",2
"Can see its already ruined. No language barrier, literally reveal almost 90% of the plot in the trailer and typical America way of fighting back which misses the visceral point of the original",0
"Finally after years and dozen of lazy movies, the RIGHT vibes in a new Alien Franchise trailer!!",2
that last scene with the tree climbing got me...:flushed_face:Whoa,2
Now this is gonna be great! :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2

Its gonna be tough to beat the original.,0

The way McAvoy switches characters is just flawless.,2
Yall dont have to watch the movie you know. Get over it. Yall aint gonna get a 2d animation of it and yall wont. Become an animator and make it yourself,1
Halle is always saving some children love her,2
Probably great acting but a very creapy movie. No thank you,2
Saw this before strangers cant wait,2
Amazing. It is a mistake to not have this universe be in the same universe as the new DCU.,2
Please god let this be good please god let this be good,2
Points for originality i guess,1
"Logan was the perfect ending to Hugh Jackman, but im gonna allow this movie",2
The twist.......the daughter is the killer.,1

DC dropping some good stuff compared to woke-ed Marvel,2
"Somehow, the older movie had better visuals.",0
Yup ... I will skip it,0

This looks fascinating.,2
Why do they keep giving her the same roles:face_with_monocle:,0
No movie has ever been made to match a good book - but this book is better than many good books…,2
Trailers are just spoilers nowadays. I feelLike Ive watched the movie already :face_with_rolling_eyes:,0
No way dicaprio,1
"The original was amazing, I know its just a trailer but it seems to have added way more stuff while the orginal was very sinister and gave your the uneasy feeling by being more understated. Plus I think the cultural element adds to it immensely and explains why they ignored the red flags and stayed...",0
Welp wont be watching this lol :grinning_squinting_face: I cant do it,0
what is the title of the background Music?,1
"Colman Domingo is such a force of an actor. I think maybe the earlier seasons of Fear the Walking Dead gave him much more exposure than hed had before, the minute I started hearing his first monologue in that cell I was so intrigued from the get-go. He and the actor who played Nick I think were easily the best actors for me in that show, would love to see them work together again with how amazingly well Colman Domingo is doing and Frank Dillane is back acting again. Their acting chemistry was so good in that and that OG crew loved each other it was so sweet. Its so good to see Colman Domingofinally get his flowers amazing projects:red_heart:",2
This is the first CBM trailer I have been watching daily in years,2
I need these two to get with the Avengers so they show them how its done,1
Plot twist shes a kidnapper with mental illness and she brainwash those boys,1
"Ambient sounds can make the movie incredibly immersive, and of course, the subtle rumbling of subwoofers takes it to the next level.Movies are 50% visuals and 50% audio, and their are occasions when the audio out does the visuals.What Im trying to say is dont leave a movie of this quality to the speakers on a TV. One has to have at least a soundbar.Our eyes follower ears to wear the story lives.",2
Is there a reason they are chasing it with wats on their truck,1
So this just looked like a reimagined version of the The Lion King...hmm........:thinking_face:,1

I can see it now:But Megatron isnt BLACK!GROW UP!,0
"Can It not come out a bit sooner. IWe honestly cant wait. Please, please. Two of my favourite actors in a biker film WHAT!?",2
"In the twister movie they made it feel like each twister had a mind of its own. How the characters always referred to them as not a thing but a personality. It made it even scarier for me as a kid, it made it feel like these things wanted to kill you. Its like jaws but killer clouds.",0
A lion was born without a drop of nobility in his blood that makes no sense. Why would Scar (Mufasas older brother) believe that he has a claim to the throne of the pridelands if they werent the sons of the previous king of the pridelands? Did we just destroy the entire plot of the Lion King with one careless overdub?,0
"Not a good book, a great book. A story thats magical and immediate, heartfelt and deserving of the greatest care. 16 episodes. I cant wait!",2
"Ohhh, its Cuck-oo!Wrong vid. Ill see myself out.",1
Another horror movie?? Exactly what we dont need,0
I think this trailer just showed the whole movie,0
Looks good for a disaster movie but dont see how they can call it a sequel if doesnt tie into the other movie. Is there a plot line Im missing? Is the girl supposed to be Jo and Bills kid?,0
"Stop giving a teaser at the beginning of a trailer, so pointles",0
For once a long trailer where it doesnt spoil the movie…. Great job :clapping_hands_medium-light_skin_tone:,2

"Growth comes with dedication,hard work, consistentency, and most of all unending strategy in achieving your investment goals.",2
"wow, i think itll be a hard one to watch, but i cant imagine skipping it. sometimes you need a good challenge like this to keep yourself in check.",2
Nice finally a trailer that doesnt give the whole movie away,2
People are complaining yet alot of you keep watching this. Did you know that the last lion king (2019 version) is the highest selling animated movie of all time? Its because a lot of you dumbassess watch this which signals Disney to make more!!!!,1
Looks pretty nuts.,2
wheres the mask...,1
Looks like a good concept!,2
So this is what they give back after we shelled out over a billion $??? We get a prequel. Let me guess. Its about a lion cub destined to be a great king.... :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:My brain is hurt.,0
Benedryl reallyyyyy doesnt need to bring his Oscars game for legit every single movie he makes.. this is a lifetime movie :popcorn: a missing kid? Sad puppeteer? Didnt Jim Carey already do this?? But better :face_with_tears_of_joy:,0
A24 should stick to scary movies.  This looks boring.,0
Fuckkkk. The original was so awful they didnt need this remake.,0
I have no expextacions and no reason to belive that it would be amazing visual and emotional jonery... I think at best it would be enjoyable horror.,2
"Well…it does look good. There is hope. The franchise is one bad movie away from the Terminator dustbin for me, so fingers crossed.",2
RIP Bill Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman :slightly_frowning_face:,1
His makeup and maneirisms remind me of Robert De Niro in The Untouchables.Anyone else seeing this?,1
Penguin and his mob are the Al Capone mob of Gotham Cities underworld this is going to be great:smiling_face_with_sunglasses:,2
"Without Bill Paxton, Philip Seymour Hoffman and flying cows this has no chance of doing the original justice.",0
"The original movie was very brutal....  it felt like it could actually happen, I even told my friend who has a son who actually told me about this movie not to watch it. This version looks... like a movie, if it makes sense.... its too colorful and movie-ish.... The 2022 movie looks like a real life... with muted tones and beautiful setting... but Ill still watch this one out of curiosity",0
This looks fantastic!,2
"Gordon and Cameron are married?!?  (If you know, you know.)  :winking_face:",1
"Looks good, but I wish hollywood would stop with the remakes and actually come up with something original.",2
Uh why?,0

Ryan Reynolds page has 3x more views than Marvel....let that sink in disney!! You need a Lil Reynolds in you,2
"Give us new characters to build around, let Ripley and everyone one else rest. Give us 2-4 survivors to build a cast around for the sequel, the sets and art look perfect just give us a half way decent script.",2
gayest trailer ever,0
This looks bonkers. Cant wait to see it. This and Longlegs.,2
One of the best books.   But I just dont want to experience it ever again.,0
"Plot twist, Jamie is the one theyre looking for.",1
Is this the same time period as the  Alien: Isolation game? Between Alien 1 & Aliens(2) while Ripley in stasis and thats supposed be her daughter?,1
The original is better,0
Dont you just love it when McAvoy plays evil guys. He just has this something in his eyes :eyes:,2
Im always curious to see what unintelligible voice Tom Hardy is going with.,0
7 season of Sopranos will be perfect.Tony Soprano looks very fresh,2

"The beast from split got a family , i love james McAvoy so much :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:",2
I cant wait to see this movie and the original movie,2
Im a fan of scoot mcnairys underrated actor imo,2
"Mike Faist got two movies pushed back to this year. Hopefully he gets some love for this or Challengers, despite having a smaller role here.",2
The original Danish version is currently on Shudder. Great movie,2
IF YOU FEEL IT?,1

JOSH HARTNETT THE OG!!! THE ONE!!! S TIER ACTOR!,2
The music ruined the trailer,0
We added an S to make it look like it is not a remake. Did you see?! Did you see?! We are just so clever!!,0
"This looks very interesting and Im curious to see how this fares when it comes to Shyamalans approach to telling this story, since the trailer tells us who the killer is.This may be the closest hell get to making a HItchcock thriller. Either way, Im intrigued.",2
This is fire.,2
Why am I crying over a GD trailer??!?!?!,2

"This shit is so dumb, cant believe he stopped filming Sherlock to make garbage like this. Every Every",0
Do we need to see a full body xenomorph in an Alien movie? I think we dont. The only thing we need is to know it is stalking around and some other close shot. Do you agree?,1
So excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
Romulus? Will VLas and Stehl be in it?,1
A prequel? New ideas please.,0
I watched this film a couple of years ago (danish version) and just reminding of how it ends creeps me out. Left me feeling so disgusted and disturbed.,1
 Liefelds - Just Feet,1
Im surprised. Is Peter Cullin in the movie?,1
not diversity enough:face_with_tears_of_joy:,0
This movie doesnt seem disnified. I may watch.,2
"Finally, a good recent Marvel film",2
why spoil it though.....,0
Loving that this is the official trailer and was not an alt-cut preceeded by a scary looking red-band notice.,2
This looks promising!,2
"Finally, a family reunion crazier than mine!",2
"Oh noooooooooo...........I thought they learned from their mistakes.Why is there another annoying girlboss/enemy to suck the fun out of the movie? Male antagonists bring so much more to the table. Thats nit sexist, just facts.I mean, just name one female baddie that went down in history. I cant come up with any.",0
I LOVE HALLE BERRYI. LOVE.  HALLE BERRY.DID I MENTION I L O V E  HALLE BARRY Yup..thats it…thats  all!,2

Ngl the life action was so popular Im not surprised theyre going to try and milk it,0
two things to like ...1. James2. Only in Theatres.,1
I stopped watching after the in-your-face homosexual sidetrack (the cop and his partner).  LGBT representation in the movies really messes the whole show up.   Has nothing to do with the story and its hard to ignore.,0
Guys did you all saw that Ant-man suit  ,1
This trailer gives me mix feelings.,0
"In space no one can hear... literally anything, because of noise",1
"I am VERY cautious about my expectations for this film, but I got to admit: the vibe in this teaser trailer are on effing point",2
DC cannot make hero s now.. Villains are on the spotlight,1
Yes get Madonna in there,1

Is that a decision you regret?What a scumbag (the character) lol.,1
Well this is going to make me cry my eyes out,0
I read this book and remember nothing of it. I just know its about a very big family where everyone has almost the same name.,1
"2003: Gothika2024: Never Let Go...been a while since Halles last horrorAlex Aja directed The Hills Have Eyes, Piranha, and Crawl.Hope its rated R",1
Wow. I talked so much crap but its going to put the Sopranos to shame. Ill watch. I just hope it doesnt get cut because fans are just waiting for Batman to show up.,2
its always women,0
"This film looks gorgeous. Retro, but not in a way that feels like a hackneyed pastiche.",2
time to read this book again.:red_heart:,2
I can already see this being another thousand times recycled shitty jump scare horror.,0
"I hate a trailer that gives away more than I feel like it should, but hey this could be good, and honestly M has been kinda killing it.",1
Was she wearing A gun Holster at the end?,1
Looks REALLY AWFUL. Every cliche in the book.,0
Im really disappointed that the lead females are so young! Helen Hunt was so timeless and didnt look like a teenager. Its just not believable.,0
I am so happy to see Domingo acting again,2
Shouldnt it be called Aliens: Romulus? i saw more than one facehugger.,1
"You just HAD to put in a deepthroat scene, huh? Couldnt help yourselves, could ya?",0
James is becoming to creepy for me.,0
Could you please make MAX available in Italy???,1
Read this book when I was young...still one of the most insane story (in a great way) ive read in a book,2
I just dont understand what the national obsession with child abduction and pedophilia is.  As a parent I would never want or allow myself to watch content like this. I mean lets just cut to the chase and make some DIY movies on killing yourself.  How is this going to make me feel when my kids leave the house.  I can appreciate having the freedom to make subject matter like this but I also appreciate my freedom to make a comment on YouTube and never watch it.,0
PLEASE BE GOOD I LOVEEEE ALIEN,2
Do I need to watch all of Penyworth to understand whats going on in this show?,1
"Idk why but that serious tone of the transformers is gone , looks like a comedy film than transformers....",0

Even hardcore Disney fans are confused why this is a thing,0
 Just noticed the lady with those finger claws from X2 on the front left and Azazel from First Class on the right.,1
"Disney just cant take a hint can they? Also if youre reading this Disney, do not make anymore star wars films",0
"Okay... I hate to say it, but I dont think this is for me. Its giving off vibes of one of the original Bionicle movies with the goofy dialogue.",0
They should have let Wolverine rest ! Dont like the tone of this at all !,0
"One thing Ive realized about so called Scary Movies is that , The Demons have not personality! if Demons exist, You dont think they have more personality than humans. These writers , Directors and people in film are doing horrible jobs. Dont get me wrong I will be checking out this film. Im just saying overall... I think people in the world have lost their imagination.",0
I am loving the return to 70s/80s film aesthetics.,2
WTH is this messed up show ?!Mad symbolism,0
Didnt they learn theyre lesson from how much people didnt like the 1st movie,0

Colin Farrell as The Penguin is one of the best casting decisions a studio can make.,2
Colman Domingo will never fail to make me WEEP :loudly_crying_face:,2
My most awaited series. It is such a difficult book to adapt into a series. I just hope they dont mess it up.,2
it honestly looks like just another woman torture porn movie. Meh.,0
This is how they should expand a world for a franchise. Penguin is a great character and deserves his time to shine. Im glad Colin Farrell gets to do this and really explore him in a series.,2
This is the one Marquez book I havent read. Everyone sounds excited. Im...wary more due to my feelings about Netflix as a whole. Maybe I should dive in show first to be less disappointed.,1
Im so excited to see Halle Berry back in a horror movie! :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::clapper_board::movie_camera::admission_tickets::film_frames::popcorn:,2
Based on the thumbnail I thought this was going to be a David foster Wallace biopic,1
Will it be available in India as well?,1
"Back when The Batman trailer came out, I thought Collin Farrell was playing a lower role in the movieI NEVER would have guessed he was the Penguin in that trailer- hes had an amazing comeback",2
I was sceptical about the puppet following him around but I admit the whole thing seemed to be very well done. I definitely dont regret watching it.,2
OMG I cant wait... got chills,2
Lets f*** go! :fire::fire:,2
Wait.. is that THE WATCHERS film poster when the police move through the tunnel in the trailer???,1
Is this a sequel or a remake? If its a remake Im skipping it,0

"I was brought up by listening to stories about this book, my mom was a literature teacher and shed always go on about how this was her favorite book. When I finally read it as an adult, it did not disappoint in the slightest. Better read(if possible) in Spanish, it is very hard to translate the argot and slang to another language, but still a fantastic book and probably one of the best in Latin American literature.",2
Dude the fkn payd of indian bots who all comment on JAMES. Like they are following him for a decade is so annoying. Makes me complantate even watching the movie...,0
These silly guys are here to save the Marvel Universe.Lets F****** Go...:heart_on_fire:,2
No way this is gonna end like the original.,1
He reminds me a lot of Dr. House in this show. Extremely witty and mean. I finished the show in two days and it was so good. I was drawn in the whole time. It has a good balance with funny/dark moments.,2

Hope we get a Batman 2 teaser or something at the end of this,2
"So is this supposed to be before the Golden Age of Cybertron? I ask because in the Aligned story line way back Megatron was a miner, but Orion im not sure. I do know Orion ended up a clerk or I guess Librarian of sorts before he was Optimus. I just figure this is before Cybertron was freed from the Quintessons.",1

"Time to play: Guess the Twist!1. He never had a daughter, its all in his mind. In fact, he gets caught at the end of the film when he tells the cops that he came with his daughter - but he only has 1 ticket the entire time.2. The Daughter has been imprisoned at home her whole life. This is the first time that she has ever been to the outside. He gets caught when the police casually interviews her - and realizes she knows nothing about the world.3. The Cops never existed. Hes just paranoid.4. The Cops were never there for the Butcher (The Black dude was wrong, as it was all just speculation from fans). Instead, the Cops are here for something even more sinister.",1

"Colman Domingo has to be one of the biggest over-actors Ive seen in a long, long time. He acts as if there is no one else even in the frame with him. I bet the other actors all hate having to work with a hamsteak like him. He couldnt give a normal line reading if his life depended on it.",0
It used to be nice not to see some things in a trailer. In 2024 its those things you dont see until you invest yourself into an episode that ruin a show. RIP Halo the rainbow show,0

I have watched this trailer a lot. And tbh its mostly because of Like A Prayer. Someone should give that singer a record contract.,2
"It looks like J.J. Abrams decided to reboot Transformers.  Dumb, frivolous.  It looks like OP, Megatron, and Bumblebee are the only Transformers they know about.  No Ironhide.  No Prowl.  No Huffer.  No Thundercracker.  No Wheeljack.  Neither has the spirit of the old cartoon nor the comic book.  And I started with Transformers #1. You can have this reboot.  It may make money, but I dont care.  Nobody gets TF.  Im even more pessimistic about GI Joe.",0
wow.. beautiful...,2
The original still haunts me to this day. I dont know why theyre remaking it.,0
"Fede Alvarez, and Ridley Scott... If they focus on making it a horror movie, and not some bullshit sci-fi with an Alien slapped on the cover, this one might have a chance.",2
"Damn, a twist IN the trailer??? I thought it was going to be some sort of experiment or messed up thing where they all get trapped, but this is new!",1
"The nature of how the book is written makes it really difficult to adapt to the screen. A lot of it doesnt actually make sense, and isnt really supposed to. Also, the random mixing of past present and future tenses (like with the famous opening line featured here) all at once makes it all kinda mix together. It reminds me of whrn they did a movie of Everything is Illuminated. Yes, they can make a very nicw movie, but this type of novel just cant really be translated to film. If it is a very nice film, it will still be very different.",0
So... Is it a crossover with Star Trek now?,1
"Im calling it now, his daughter is part of it too.",1
Question to only true fans : Is that Ultra Magnus  if yes then Lets Go !!:red_heart: Finally!:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2

They just gave the movie away lol,1
"Pff, didnt sing even once, let alone twice.",0
Its a shame this trailer is going to get burried by the Transformers One trailer,0
The CGI looks like something out of Pixar. This ones for the kids,0
Cumberbatch is always awesome,2
"This puts me in mind of bird box, a quiet place and Arcadian, normally I would say its trash but because its Ms. Berry, I guess Ill give it a chance",2
Am I the only one who thinks this is creepy,2
Damnit.  i dont watch horror movies... but Dan Stevens!  What to dooooo?!?,2
Rule 34 sites and reddits are ready to have a field day :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,2
Benedict Cumberbatch spells quality. We will be seated.,2
A24 should make a streaming service for all their movies and tv shows they gave a lot of good movies and tv shows,2
This move has alot of potential! Unlike rotb,2
"Looks nice, thrilling and surprising. Something unseen. More of it please - and not always reboots and sequels from everthing :party_popper::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:",2
Cant wait. Looks really good,2
Will be definitely seeing this!,2
:thinking_face:Godfather 2?,1
"Im an avid horror movie fan, and the trailer literally killed the movie. Okay Halle Berry has gone mad. Whether it was an abusive relationship, or lost her job, were just suffering from losing a child and depression. So she moves her children out into this woods, and convinces them that the world has ended. So she descends in the madness, convinces her children that theres an evil out there, and eventually the children are going to have to turn on their mothers so they can escape. The real crime in this movie, is how many movies do they make about strong independent black mothers, but they never make movies about strong independent black fathers, because the strong independent father is something that rarely exists in the black community which is why they suffer from poverty and crime. I promise you Im right. Come back to this comment after you insult me and call me a racist, just for stating facts,. Come back to this comment after you watch this trash movie, that is convincing the black population that all they need is a strong black mother and not a strong black father.this movie is propaganda, and were going to end up having to think that the mentally ill mother is the hero of the movie.",0
Wait megatron and optimus where friends,1
Yup all kinds of yups over here for this one,2

"Wait, that ISNT Daniel Johns from Silverchair from 1997?",1
Kinda guessed what if hes the guy,1
I dont like the premise of the movie is so close to the Etan Patz case out of NYC. I dont like that at all.,0

This is a remake of a film I watched parts of a year or so ago. :thinking_face:,1

One more masterpiece on its way,2
"Since Cillian got nominated and may win an Oscar, I now really wish Tom to get his long dued Oscar possibly for Best Supporting Actor....He was terrific in The Revenant tooo....",2
PLEASE dont ruin this,0
best opening line in all of literature,2
Bro the bumblebee run is like among us,1
"Idk how yall keep getting tricked by every Alien movie. The thing that made Alien great was its pacing and suspense. Not its action, spammed aliens and gore.",0
"Anytime the trailer gets you choked up, you know its a hit.",2
My theory is that the transformation cogs dont give them the ability to transform but instead they have code that lets them activate their transforming parts,1
This show looks like it will be great but the trailer feels off-ish.,2
This movie looks horrible and fake...black people have a history of hating the woods and rope.,0
Why would they create a film about a young cub who we all know will end up getting brutally murdered as an adult lion? Now thats cruel.,0
Dropping the same day as sonic 3 is nasty work :skull: sonic going 3 for 3 crushing movies at the box office,0
i cannot wait to get a deeper look into the Gotham that Matt Reeves is creating. A dark and gritty Gotham just like the best comics in the Batman series. This show looks phenomenal and I cannot wait to see the Batman 2 in 2026,2
Not every character needs an origin story. Do better Hollywood,0
We are so Back!!!!,2
"Tell me, will the actors promote the film? will there be press tours?",1
Wow :red_heart:awesome :heart_suit: :OK_hand_light_skin_tone:,2

Yeh   It sure why everyone has to be gay in this show  Its obvious the Obamas helped edge this along   Awful  could have been good,0
Yup. Just as I thought. Looks like an Alien movie.,1
This is pure horror. No white male left in the future.,0
OH MY GODDD HUNTER IS GOING TO FUCKING KILL IT I LOVE HER SO MUCH,2
"Norman Reedus, Tom Hardy! This would be awesome!",2
The book is simply brilliant. You can read it again every year and still find something new.,2
This is a remake of a film I cant remember Mista GG covered it,1
"This is the first adaptation ever of the novel, except for a loose and unauthorized Japanese film. Marquez refused to sell the rights himself, as he believed a film could not cover the entire book. (And as a major admirer of the book, no, it cant.) This is a sixteen-episode series.No pressure to adapt one of the greatest books ever written. No pressure.",1
"It looks great, but the way they keep pushing back the release makes me nervous.",0
I never would of thought that Disney would let them do an R-rated Deadpool. I thought for sure this would be a watered down version of the character...but it seems it really isnt. Cant wait for this!,2
At last we got the duo we wanted onscreen . Extremely excited for this film.,2
"Should have made it low-budget, practical effects and make it look and feel like an 80s movie instead of relying on trash CGI and Big effects for it disrespects the Classic movies.",0
Halle berry movies always have an interesting plot twist at the end.,2
"I remember the first time I heard about sing sing was in 2012 when U-god said I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin on ginseng Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king",1
It feels like there will be another twist and other than him being the killer. I feel like itll be the daughter who is the killer and he is trying to protect her,1
So little pieces of smoke energy are inside one field and all these little pieces that make up this field are different condensities so when they collide they can pack into each other...Becoming more condensed in pulling on the second field thats around the first field condensing it because it compacts into that space because it connects then what we see from gravitation anyway...Is the field being created by the first field when it becomes condense enough to condense  the second field it also pulls in other little pieces...From its field that are different condensities.... Creating a field around the graviton that acts like an electromagnetic field....:alien::smiling_face_with_halo::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::face_with_rolling_eyes::winking_face_with_tongue:...Basically the reason we see everything I talked about in the other videos... Or audios... Is whenever you get closer to a field of gravity .... Other gravitational pulls become more condensed because the other gravitational field starts to condense it more and we can say this happens because theyre different little pieces.... condensing the other gravity around it pulling in the object...If ultimately you think the election was hacked whats the point in promoting yourself.. for president when you didnt win the last time you think youll be able to rig the election this time,1

Is this gonna be a musical drama?,1
OMG where can I watch this??????????? Netflix?,2
"Listen, this is one of those shows that holds you hostage and drains you in an empty cat and mouse game to give you all the resolutions in the last episode. Did I skip the whole trauma bs and just skipped to the end? Hell yes I did!! And I didnt miss out on a single thing. Regardless, very uncomfortable two episodes, we all have enough trauma irl. I just watched for Benedict but oooff did I hate this.",0

Just another horror movie.  So tiring...,0
When I saw this and heard who Austin Butler was playing I thought is this the same story the song Bikeriders by Lucero(one of my fav bands) is based on.  Then I saw Michael Shannon was in it and knew because he was in a Lucero music video/ short film that the singer Ben Nichols lil brother Jeff Nichols directed it just as he did the music video.,1
"Ill give it a shot. I like the more campy versions of Penguin, but Colin is a great actor. The writing just needs to be there.",2
Im confused because there Timon and pumbaa wtf???,0

"Wow, Im honestly surprised that they decided to reference the character of Rex Calabrese. Hes a lot more of a minor character but he was the Don of the Gotham Mob before Falcone came into power. I wonder if were going to see Calabrese in a flashback or something.",1
"If its good enough for Benedict, its good enough for me!",2
"I seriously  recommend first read the book, so wont seem illiterate in the comment section",2

Cuckoos are know to lay eggs in other birds nests so that they are fed by the new parents. The hatchling cuckoo even throw the original eggs out if they can. My guess is that theyre all aliens from a big family being brought back together. DUUUUUUMB. They already did it in Vivarium,1

Matt Reeves doing Matt Reeves things.,1
"It almost makes you feel bad for people in prison, but then you realize theyre in there for a reason.

"Whatever dude. Of course Tom Hardy has to distort his voice, he can never just talk like a normal person. Heres pretty much just a straight up Caucasian cast and he has to go for some Italian accent (???). And not buying Butler as a badass biker. Maybe if this was about the Village People Id buy it. Sons of Anarchy already did this btw, and better.",0

"The thematic resemblance to Ian McEwans 1987 novel, The Child in Time, is unmistakable, echoing its exploration of grief and loss amidst the backdrop of familial turmoil. This connection is further underscored by the 2017 film adaptation starring Benedict Cumberbatch, directed by Julian Farino. Premiering on BBC One in September 2017, the film brings McEwans poignant narrative to life, with Cumberbatch delivering a compelling performance.McEwans novel revolves around Stephen, a childrens book author, and his wife, grappling with the aftermath of their daughter Kates abduction. The narrative delves into the complexities of their grief and the strain it puts on their relationship, offering a nuanced portrayal of sorrow and resilience.While The Child in Time garnered praise, winning the prestigious Whitbread Novel Award in 1987 and earning acclaim as one of McEwans seminal works, it also faced criticism for its perceived heavy-handedness. Nonetheless, its enduring impact on literature and its ability to provoke thought and emotion remain undeniable. Source Wikipedia",2

Bout time Glen Powell not just a damn pilot in a movie,2
"If they were ever going to film this book, it needed to be in Spanish and it needed to be episodic.  It also helps that the we are at a stage in modern film/TV wherein the notion of subtle special effects can be employed.  In my mind, the magical realism of the novel was matter-of-fact. The sense of wonder has to come from the narrative itself and the themes rather than the window dressing.  I dont know if the film will be able to capture this aspect properly.  To be brutally honest, the resume of the directors - one is frankly a bit schlocky, and the other seems talented by untested - does not film me with a lot of confidence. I will need to wait to hear how it is after its been out for a while because the last thing I want to do is override the perfect imagery generated by reading the novel.",1

"Not what I was expecting, turns out another kids 3dcgi movie but admittedly seems fun kids transformers. Chris Hemsworth voice is very funny for Optimus and their former names scene was epic. Scarletts voice is hot for pink robot! And Wait, Steve Buscemi is in too!?!!! :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 5:00am",2
I was promised homosexuality.,1
"Love everything about this trailer. One question I have though is when the staff person said checking everyone, what exactly are the cops looking for to definitively say who The Butcher is? lol I assume he wouldnt be walking around with obvious evidence on him",2
Why i have a feeling that Ive seen this film before…,1
Next movie gonna be called (Dont Go),1

Colin in channeling his inner DeNiro heavy for this.,1
Assume its based on the Hollister riot July 3-6 1947. and the early days of Outlaw Bikers 1%ers,1
"Soooo, one thing I noticed is the girls half sisters name is Alma. I could be wrong but thats the name of the girl from Fear(game). Which is psychological. The girls Dads brought her to the resort, said their family belonged there. He did something to the rest of the family and is doing it to her. But what is it? Transforming them in to birds, Dr Moreau style? Or feeding them to the locals? I think the first.",1
This looks like a beautiful movie.,2
Fat Bastard stated he was disappointed Helen Hunt isnt in it,0

If I were Edgar I wouldnt want to come home either. His parents suck.,0
damn this looks good! but i feel like the trailer showed way more than it shouldve lol,2
"Love to see Halle Berry back, but.... This is giving Bird Box nonsense. The only way this makes any sense is if the plot is like another commentor suggested, that her character is actually experiencing psychosis and all the shit she sees isnt really happening",0
Looks kind of stupid gonna be a fail,0
Masculinity is finally coming back to movies!!!,2

Took two seconds for me to realize this is a remake of one of my favorite 2022 horror movies. It was disturbing and frustrating and I cant wait to understand more of the nuance now that I can understand the language and culture,2
Good to see Gerard Butler back in shape.,2
I have never seen such a good series for  a long time it had every episode something that just explode my head. But at the end it all made sense and the message behind all is crazy. Thank you hwo ever did this one,2
Is cool that they are making a penguin series because they could have easily made a joker series,2

"Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love. God showed how much He loved us by sending His one and only Son Jesus into the world so that we might have eternal life through Him. This is real love-not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins.(1John 4:7-10, paraphrased)Jesus is coming, Guys; let us all have genuine faith in Jesus and get ready:grinning_face_with_big_eyes:",1
Tagline: If you thought Madame Web was bad...,0
Trailer that is not giving us any clue :astonished_face:,1
The acting looks terrible; they redid scenes from the original which is lazy and lacks creativity; the actors arent close to the same calibre as the original; the only good thing about this trailer is the cgi effects… very underwhelming.,0
What the! No James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa!?!?!??? Disgraceful,0
Would be very much better if the voice artists were added in the movie instead of a fully animated movie.,1

Honestly the Colonel looks weak to slim! I didnt like this teaser,0
Why is there a Moana 2? Why is there a prequel to an already done franchise and also…WHY IS THERE ANOTHER TOY STORY. Seriously,0
So this film is a mixture during the transformers uprising and the corrupted casting system,0
why seems like hunters voice has been changed?,1

You cant replace Bill Paxton (RIP), Helen Hunt or Philip Seymore Hoffman (RIP); not happening. Nor can you replace Van Halens (RIP Eddie) awesome soundtrack. Also love all the potential girl bosses featured here well done.

Optimus Prime: Autobots Transform and roll out.Megatron: decepticons transform and rise up,1
My goodness the movie industry has gone to shit. We have hardly any new ideas. Its all remakes and reboots. Anyone who thinks the timing of it being all remakes/reboots and all this woke garbage occurring simultaneously is an idiot.,0
"finally one movie focus only in optimus and cia, the catch is a comedy.......",2
Ossining NY .Lived there over 30+ yrs.AKA Sing Sing City,1

"Would love to see Victor Strand in anything, even if there are no zombies.",2
"Another remake horror movie originated from Europe cinema, I suggest you to watch the 2022 made original one with same title name as well guys. However i will watch this remake too for the sake of James McAvoy who is the offical actor of psychopathic roles.",2
not only looks wonderfully weird but i for one would be glad to see MARTON CSOKAS in something that expands his range.,2

tom hardy always delivers :OK_hand:,2
The first film scared me as a kid. Tornadoes in general are horrifying.,0
This was perfect! Didnt spoil anything…X-men97 and Deadpool are carrying the MCU on their back right now!,2
Just what Ive never wanted: another remake of a solid movie but re-cast with soy-faced zoomers and bad actors and given a screenplay that removes character in favor of over-saturated effects-brinkmanship. I hope this is a massive financial failure and that everyone involved lives a paupers life.,0
HELL YES!,2
I think its gonna be more like The Others where Halles character is a spirit doing what she can to keep her sons spirits tethered to a place they can all be together after having died many years before,1

Somewhere Neil Blomkamp sits quietly alone internally raging after seeing this trailer.,1
Ah the gold ol story of a honest biker club eventually losing there way and getting involved in everything illegal under the sun. Dw abt the story its the cast that makes this story of a movie great. Tom hardy never disappoints,2
Not sure there will be an audience for this.  I mean the Penguin is no Joker!  They needed another villain  faction to make it really work like the Ridler.,0
"Yup, I have to see this one",2
Put a lesbian in it and make it LAME!,0
Looks good but Im pretty sure I know whats going to happen. Pretty much its going to show their lives living in the woods with ropes . Then the scary stuff is going to happen. The boy is wondering hmm maybe we can leave. The mom tells them no thats what it wants you to think. He tries to branch off again and it turns out the mom is just afraid and whatever is causing the scary stuff to happen has driven her insane. The world didnt end at all and everyone on the outside have been living their normal lives this entire time . So  theyre going to leave her in there or kill her because shes going to try to stop them from escaping. Thats why she pulled the knife on him.,1
Looks like they took it back with this one!! Lets go!! :fire::fire::fire::fire:,2
It 100% better then any transformer movie from past 10 years :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:,2

Id much rather a classic animated Lion King 3.,0
i have waited my entire life to see this and it looks amazing,2
I take it that Oswald Cobblepot will be the DC equivalent to Tony Soprano! Okay got it!!Also I wouldve prefer the character having a British accent but yeah having a Brooklyn/Italian accent kinda makes more sense!,2

Schizophrenia? Psychosis? Poor kids... looking forward to seeing this.,2
Idk but I dont think those are her kids,1
Which song is this?,1
 Me trying to introduce myself to the quiet kid and his friends,1
"This is what we want, an independent stories that are not necessarily tied to some universe. Just like the comic books when we were kids, you could pick up whatever Spider man, X men, Wolverine/Hulk or what ever comic and it was just a story in time. You didnt have to already read all the other comics. You could just as easily make Iron Man movie that didnt have anything to do with the main universe like it has been since 2008 Iron Man 1. Give us the golden age again...",2
Im guessing josh hartnett is going to be the serial killer that chops everyone up,1
Nepotism anyone?,0
James McAvoy is a beast,2

Will this tie into Covenant or any other Alien film?,1
"sigh.... here we go again. I had high hopes for Prometheus, the concept was cool, the execution was a little clustzerfuck, so this continued also in Alien Covenant, which ahd quite a few decent scenes but felt not really Alien to me. Now Romulus also just seems to play of the well established tropes by neither offering something new nor having the same breakthrough uniqueness and tension of the original. this could very well be a sequel to prometheus. I know it is unfair to judge already, but that is just the vibe I am getting. I mean, compare the grit, the non-complete actors, the sweat, the grease on the faces in the first alien with the picture-perfect, make-up attended cast here. you see it in the shots. It looks great visually, but also totally predictable and boring. Too shiny, to high end. This is supposed to be a freaking mining vessel or something, why does it look like concept art for a video game. does not compute to me. The alien shorts that were done a few years ago were really cool. This looks like them somewhat, but does not feel like a great new piece in the alien universe.",0

My entire world changed after a friend let me borrow this book from her grandfathers collection back when I was in highschool.

I swear i watched this movie but with different actors.,1
"IMO the Batman is the best thing to come out of that entire era. of DC pre-James Gunn takeover. That scene where penguin is tied up and trying to walk is SO FVCKING BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!! My dumb self was the only one who clapped in the FULL theatre when i caught that moment :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face: i was SOOOOOO IMPRESSED by that little attention to. detail...... Also, when penguins car tipped over and batman looked like a bat hanging upside down..... CHEFS KISS! Oh yeah and the movie was 10/10 :face_with_tears_of_joy:",2

"Ive always considered this book yo be impossible to film, like the Dune series. I am curious as to how they will manage it.",1
See the Penguin was called The Gentleman Criminal so I wonder if in a way this is incorporated on this story based on his monologue.,1
And then one of them got released and chopped a dudes head off.,0
"This is how empty and hollow the movie industry is. They literally cant create new, original movies.Always have to take the classics and re-make them into typically shitter versions. They cant even adapt a book or game, which has the literal blueprint for its success, onto the screen without f-ing it up.Starting looking over seas for actual bangers because American entertainment is dying.",0
I feel like the title is a pretty big spoiler,0
Hope its not missing the comic relief the original had.,1

I Gotta See This :face_with_open_mouth:,2
Still dont understand about this movie :grinning_face_with_sweat:,0
Im going because I think this is James mcavoys 2nd villain role way after split and he was in a Scottish movie called  Filth ware he played a antihero role and its a comedy drama I wont spoil it for those who hasnt but it was very good the ending of this trailer reminded me of a quiet place and if this kid is vocally def or on the autism spectrum thats good either way there bringing more  representation to both Communitys,2
I felt like I just watched the whole fucking movie. Do these idiots not know how to shorten a trailer to not reveal so bloody much?,0
"This looks like Love and Robots, I love it",2
Maybe re absolutely garbage movies,0
"Given the amount of delays, they should just make 2 Batman sequels back to back",1

"Gabriel Garcia Marquez refused to make this a movie. He said it was unfilmable and he wrote it against cinema creating magical realism, a feeling and essence throughout the book that could never be expressed in anything but words. I really hope they dont get this wrong. If not for monetary or artistic purposes but for attempting something that Garcia Marquez himself could not imagine and refused to do.",0
Looks neat i just hope the story wont be predictable,2
Oh shit doctor strange came back to... do... something. I dont know what... i didnt watch the trailer... but Im bored of seeing the same actors all the time. It kills the immersion,0

i LOVE that was shot on film. It looks beautiful,2
"It´s weird, yet refreshing to see something shot on film, not digital (unless it´s filter  they used in post:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:). Grainy",2
"Seriously what the fuck America ? Why do you need to Americanize every European movie ?! The original one is already perfect the way it is. Just from the top of my head: Let the right one in ( Morse ) , funny game, ring, millenium ( the girl with the dragon tattoo), Old boy… and countless more. Which were already amazing and didnt need to be made the Hollywood way.Americans needs to think that the all world speak their language ?! Dont we already ? Therefore cant you learn some yourself ?Or just learn to fucking read subtitles so you can enjoy foreign cinema !The whole planet is already watching American movies and we aint complaining and remaking them.By the way, the trailer is just a huge spoiler. Watch the original has there is some lost in translation moments ( dannish vs dutch, therefore they speak English with each other) and cultural stereotypes which makes the movie even more interesting.",0
"This movie will probably be way more interesting than the last remake, since this is a story most people arent familiar with unless youre really into the Lion King lore. And even then, they seem to be changing things up.",2
"Why does Americans always feel the need to copy great movies from other countries and pretend its their work? The original movie was great enough…. They really dont want people to watch international small movies…. Please people watch the original movie first, and support real artists, not copycats.",0
"hey man, i was gonna say something about being a fan and this hurts me, but im not gonna yap, this looks terrible and im pretty sure transformers prime had better animation",0

Halle Berry always having trouble with kids :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy: but this looks good!!,2
"Before filming and shooting starts all the major cast should do full script/movie reenactment (which would also be shot) in 10 minutes: crux/essence of the film, 20-30 mins: character interactions and 1 hour: playing out the major arc of the story, all of it should be done in improvisational way as getting to know the story and characters. Then enactments should serve as a guide not just the script.Also there should be a concept/idea of relative time with respect to filming, unless the story happens in 1 day like a chase, scenes should be shot relative to timeline of the while story so that the characters have time to grow, absorb whats happening, come up with a response keeping everything in mind and not simply reacting like starting points in the story and the actors could also be given hints/direction while waiting for the next shoot and also giving the room for the script to evolve.While shooting the film there should be some days before shooting everyone should mention how they feel as the character and what their characters perspective is, what they think about it, what are their stakes, what the situation/scene means to them/character to everyone involved in the scene.This should be done for major story changes/arcs and big scenes.",1
Itd be cool to see s WANTED Sequal with Macavoy running the new group and His daughter being manipulated to take out her Dad/Macavoy! Idk... maybe not. But Wanted was a cool movie.,2

"So, Pricilla looks like Ripley, because?, i mean, we all love ripley, she is the face of the franchise, but i find really annoying having a new protagonist, who looks like she improvised a Ripley Cosplay, kinda rob the character from being itself.",0
The shouting and big egos is certainly true of some sections of the chase crowd! ;),1
Kinda underwhelmin. If someone asked me to imagine the most boring and generic Alien trailer this would be about it.,0

"Took me a second to realize what I was looking at with that last shot.  Hey, heres a bright idea: instead of copying Ripley in every spin-off made from the Alien franchise, how about all create your own compelling characters that isnt just Strong Female Character Type 1 in a sweaty t shirt with guns?  Ive got a hunch yall fucked my favorite IP even worse now.  Set looks fantastic though, props to the designers",0

A prequel to the Remake of a Disney Classic... whyIs funny if the Lion King 2 is better than this. Is not F*cked up the Canon and is can be few times funny. Is inspired by Shakespeare Romio and Julia. This is inspired by money.,0
Where is Sandra Bullock at?,1
PLOT TWIST: Hes NOT the only Butcher in the family!,1

Hunter Schafer looks great in this,2
"I dont see it. Colin Farrell as The Penguin? Also, his mannerisms in the trailer dont match the character I grew up reading about and watching.",0
Cant wait :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,2
THIS LOOKS GOOOD. I love it when they dont RUIN the show by showing you everything in the teaser.,2
This looks like a Sons of Anarchy prequel.,0
This movie is gonna be so stressful for me cant wait :face_with_tears_of_joy:,2
Omg I am beyond thrilled :red_heart:,2
Whats the song used?,1
I can t help but think of Etan Patz when looking at this.,0
"We need a term for movies like this, where its an apocalyptic setting and you have to do/not do some specific thing in order to survive. Gimmick Survival, maybe?",1
Yes MAM...She nails movies like this!:heart_on_fire:,2
"A24, take my money and my tears",2
Oh Gosh this looks THRILLING,2
I hope he gets away :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,1
My two favorite Marvel characters are now together!,2
Now release it twisters ok,1
Holy shit is Hollywood out of ideas.,0
Welcome back Tony Soprano,1
Ive frequently mused over whether Gabos masterpiece would finally grace the screen within my lifetime. It stands as one of the most extraordinary novels ever penned. This adaptation is both long overdue and timely. I couldnt be more thrilled.,2
My kids will love it im sure.,2
I love it when Netflix works on some of my favourite novels. The Society of the Snow was great I am looking forward to this one!,2
I cant tell if thats a boy or a girl.  Either way this movie looks weird,0
McAvoy is easily one of the most talented actors of our time,2
Hugh too old for the role.,0
In 3D and 4DX.,1
James is damn good actor!!!!,2
It seems I cant download the torrent til the end of May - we need to work on that...,0
"Middle of the trailer Im jokingly thinking Oh, Josh Hartnetts the killer.  Welp…",1
Hartnetts not the killer. The guy hes holding captive is.,1
Thor and Black Widow in the Transformers universe lol,1
Spoiler: were in his mind palace!,1
I think Halle Berry is crazy in this and the world didnt end…that would be far scarier to me,1
"Oh, Im sure this movie is going to be responsible for an increase in new riders, let alone riders acting like they are in a club. I see a ton of fake cuts being bought online...",0
A town full of crazy people.. wow thats new,0
Its already springtime in Tulsa so Im good.,2
Neon and A24 just make the most delightfully bizarre and engaging horror movies,2
It is wonderful story. I remember it clearly. I have read this novel in my Bachelor degree. - English Literature . :red_heart:,2
Aww man i think the only sad thing i will miss is Dopinder driving him around. Too bad he cant drive through dimensions :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:,1
Its brilliant...but theres not a single note of ABBA music in it despite what you hear in the trailer. That was the only disappointment and I wonder why ?,2
"Netflix, you better not mess this up! There will be a whole lot of South Americans waiting to make sure this is worthy of Garcia Marquezs great opus. Myself included.That said, Im very excited to see this!!!",2
Ive seen the original and this trailer has given the whole plot away! What a pity - it looks good.,2
watching this 100,1
Tom Hardy films hit different. ..,2
"...This is so dumb, it hurt to watch. Imma go on pretending this doesnt exist.",0
Typical Netflix horseshit.,0
"Its appropriate, in my opinion, there should be notification of some sort notifying viewer when movie is non-english so we dont use it valuable time following up, only to discover this.",1
One of my favorite books,2
"spoilersJosh Hartnett in the film is truly a psychopath but it turns out that they are not looking for him but for another killer, and together with his daughter he returns home",1
Inb4 its the daughter,1
I LOVE HUNTER SM!!!!:red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,2
To anyone who actually thinks the big twist or the entire plot of the movie was given away in the first trailer… come on now think about it,2
Why is the video so low quality? Low budget garbage and it will disappoint probably,0
Im so happy for Hunter. Definitely going to watch this,2
They want us to believe that dude is a woman?,0
"Looks cinematic, feels cinematic. Sign me up!",2
"Now we need a sequel to Volcano 1997, another classic of mine",2
"Loved Coleman in Rustin, happy to see him at it again!",2
This new Twister film looks cool and interesting:double_exclamation_mark::tornado:,2
This looks pretty unique. Roll on tomorrow,2
A24 cannot miss. Colman Domingo cannot miss. This movie will destroy me in the best way possible,2
:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:Another reason for Disney to lose money,0
This looks fantastic.,2
spoiler: one of the kid died... :(,1
Wow. This movie is so lame.,0
"I just watched it on 2X Speed, now I-",1
New ram commercial goes crazy,1
the memes absorb all the grit,1
"Am I the only one who loves remakes of things I liked? Like yes, give me two, give me choices, do it again, I want it ALL",2
Yet another retread. Mindless. Lacking imagination.,0
Ive never seen a trailer just be the entire movie in such a way.. Literally every story beat and twist is revealed in this trailer.,0
"At  seconds, its showing a hindu sacred text. Its written in SANKRIT language. Its known as the mother of all the european languages. Its an Indian language spoken once widely in India. All the HINDU puranas,vedas, upanishads, epics and other sacred texts are all written in sanskrit.Now its almost gone from the subcontinent But almost all the major languages spoken in India has Sanskrit influence in it. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes::red_heart:",1
Hardys screen presence is unmatched. Makes the absolute best in the game look like secondary characters.,2
Looks ok but wont ever come close to the 1st one,0
"as a classic Alien fan of the movies and games, I dont wanna burst your bubble but the main protagonist Cailee Spaeny is in lbgtq s**t,  I feel like this is going to be another woke movie. I hope not tho. And NO, dont compare Ellen Ripley with these woke women, it has nothing to do with it.",0
So... The dad is the killer?,1
Why is bumble bee there?????,0
Who noticed Sanskrit?,1
What even is this,0
"30 seconds into the trailer and I instantly knew, the father was the butcher. :upside-down_face:",1
Why does he always choose Clever characters:grinning_face_with_sweat::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,1
Ive missed her cant wait to see it :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,2
This is coming out in my birth month! What a treat,2
WOOHOO! This reminds me of the War for Cybertron games- and the idw comics!!:sparkles:Words cannot describe the joy this sparks :sparkles:,2
Whats the uk age rating for this film?,1
The makeup is not good.,0
"So xenomorphs are gonna meet the mythical founder of Rome? I admit, interesting twist on the formula, Im curious to see how it goes!",2
This is basically the movie Happy right ? Just in a show,1
awesome job about Official Trailer (2024) from Transformers One,2
Down voting purely because IGN,0
This looks like a remake of the original,0
"Im in, STOP showing the whole fucking movie!",0
Am i crazy or did Eric come to life at the end?? Anyone see that blink,1
"Anyone in the comments from Chicago, how do you feel about Jodie Comers accent?",1
Already crying a little,2
It should have been an animated movie.,0
"Its a little more juvenile than I imagined before watching the trailer. Not a terrible thing, but doesnt appeal to me as much as Id hoped. This feels like a random offering that would pop up while youre doom-scrolling on Netflix, looking for something to watch.",0
James got buffed.,1
Im still amazed that weve reached the point where we have a trailer for the trailer at the start of videos.,1
one thing shes gonna do is protect those kids!,1
Finally movies that promote cigarette smoke again! This is gonna be good.,2
He is the Butcher in this movie....for whom the the TRAp is planned by police...  As per trailer it looks like it... Lets sees,1
I love when Dan Stevens plays unsettling characters like this. Great casting.,2
Lemme guess this mf is the butcher,1
It looks.....acceptable? The humour is kinda cartoony/kid movie/MCU-ish. I can see why Peter Cullen wasnt in this because its Im 80% sure this is not cannon to the live action movies. But in all honesty it looks like a fun movie 5 out of 10 for the effort paramount! :thumbs_up:,0
Sigh... it looks so good... but Marvel has shat on us so many times.Maybe this will be the exception... says every battered wife...,0
Definitely a movie made for kids.,1
Thank you Mufasa! With your death you showed me how cruel is the real world! And you also caused me a life long trauma!,0
"Having watched the show…the trailer did an amazing job depicting Vincents side of the drama…but failed to capture the true scope of where the series was going. [SPOILERS: PROCEED WITH CAUTION]The first few episodes, the focus was mostly on Edgars disappearance. I was on the edge of my seat because I ADORE who did it and where is it mysteries but my anticipation basically flatlined after finding out that hed just followed some homeless guy underground, who quickly whisked him to safety. I wasnt even allowed to feel nervousness for him because the homeless guy was just sooooo nice. Okay. Fine. But then the focus of the series seemingly shifted to another boy who went missing before Edgar. And the mystery cloaking him so utterly eclipsed Edgars, I couldnt help but wonder why his case wasnt the focus of the show the entire time. And maybe we couldve been steered in that direction smoothly if they werent constantly juggling long scenes of Edgar being taken of by the homeless guy and Vincents character arc to remind us who the actual main characters were. Speaking of which, Vincent was wasted quite a bit. I loved the idea that he was going to hunt for his son on his own but again, it wasnt that interesting because we knew Edgar was safe! They tried to shoot some urgency in us with the threat of that homeless woman giving him to a creep from The Lux but I wasnt convinced that anything unsavory would actually happen to him so I didnt care.They tied up too many loose ends and/or didnt pull on enough of them in regard to Edgar. The black guy living above them was a falsely accused man, the drawings from the children was just him being a niiice dude. He had so many kids toys because hes the fixer. And it wasnt a cover story. Sigh. The dude looking at him oddly at the beginning was just his moms secret lover who is a niiiice dude. The owner of The Lux is a criminal but reformed now and would neeeever now. No drama whatsoever! Again, the missing black kid was far more interesting. And I was honestly shocked at that scene and saddened at the subsequent reveal. It wrapped up too quickly and neatly for me though because we haaaad to go back to Vincent.",1
This going to be i may be scared bc i am by myself.,2
Im disappointed!  Coming soon is just not good enough!!:crying_face:,0
Honestly have no idea what the show is about....thanks.,0
Why are u letting the kids go outside if u cant let go of the rope u know what nevermind,0

I love this book. It looks good,2
"The original Speak no Evil (The Guests)  from 2022 was really unsettling!Not a perfect movie by any means but still. Im on the fence with this, even if I really like James Mc Avoy.PS. The trailer already showed too much.",0
WHO ELSE WATCHED THE TRAILER 2 TIMES?:face_with_tears_of_joy:,2

I only hope they do Cien años de soledad justice. Rooting for this!,2
I wish we had a direct sequel to Prometheus. Alien Covenant doesnt answer so many questions that Prometheus asked.,0
Great cast! This has an old school vibe to it. Looks worth it.,2
Im seeing an awful lotta stuff regurgitated from the first film..I really hope its not just some bullcrap reboot!,0
Sons of Anarchy vibes,1
"Jules moved again, somebody tell Rue",1

"I am really looking forward to this movie.  I will watch it as soon as possible, it looks great",2
Weve got cows (again.),1
Even with just a trailer you can already see Austin will be the standout character/performance in this film,2
"God damn, Ive seen other movies try to imitate the humanity that was shown in just the trailer for this movie. Gonna be a day 1 for me.",2
At first sight i hate it. And now im so obsessed i keep watching this trailer after every two hours everyday. HELPP:hot_face:,2
Great To See Halle Again!,2
They should have made this an animated film,1
"If this is where the monarchy is headed, county out!",0
The original is so good but I am here for it,2

This trailer is awesome.,2
"This is not needed, but if they had to do it this shouldve definitely been 2d animated!",0
"So far 24 has been kicking ididass when comes to Horror movies. Even Chris Stuckman, Jeremy Jahns agree like the new Omen just came out",2
Never been afraid to admit ABBA hits hard sometimes. :grinning_face_with_sweat:That remix hyped the hell out of this for me!Need more trailers like this btw.. leave us confused.,2

"Yeah, the mom has some sort of mental disorder/breakdown, and the world is just fine. They figure this out at the end.",1
"Trailer was good. Just watched the show, spoiler alert it really sucked. They tried to make a murder mystery targeting too many political issues and failed. Acting from BC was good, but poor writing and bad plot",0
I cant wait!!,2
Stop with the remakes and make something original,0
Im crying legit tears this looks so beautiful. I cant wait,2

Hope Disney go back to old school animation one day ghiblis are great but so long between each one,1
Growing up in Chicago in 1960s my older brother and his biker buddies rode with clubs and I can tell you from what I know and saw this trailer is very accurate down to style of their bikes! Cant wait to see. Even though my brother was killed in Vietnam in 1970 his influence on me with Harleys has always been a part of my life!,2
"The Danish version stuck with me for a while after watching. Feels like theres a ton being given away in this trailer that may spoil it a bit. I love the cast, and it looks pretty faithful to the Danish version, but Im curious if it will be as bleak and haunting as the original was…",1
A comic book movie I actually am looking forward to!,2
Arcadian with a woman,1
"Idk, this looks like a normal movie. Remember the last time he tried making a normal movie? His domain is in supernatural thrillers. He should just stick at that.",0
Why...why...why...FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY WHY!!!??? NOBODY ASKED FOR THIS.,0
Ted Mosbys wife before she met him,1
"Im sorry, but the original and iconic Twister of 1996 dont need this.",0
Love the effect of this trailer!! Enticing without being revealing...,2
Lacks all the elegance of the Penguin of the books (so did Burtons/DeVitos).  Makes him just another low-class hood...,0
James has morphed into the lovechild of russell crow and gerard butler,2
The first one was a huge let down in my opinion. This one probably wont be any better. Im not gonna get my hopes up. Honestly Im kinda surprised that Disney didnt make Mufasa a black lion lol smh,0
So when somethings a secret . Keep it secret :shushing_face:… especially something as serious as this,1
Wow! l have not seen halle berry in a movie in a long while . This looks good!,2
They made TF a Disney movie...  Ill still judge the script and dialogue,1
Goddamn now Im too excited for this. Gonna be a long wait,2
So the dad is the butcher?,1
You need Scar. They were brothers.,1
The real twist is that the real butcher is the daughter or the daughter is in on it.,1
I just want to watch Tom Hardy,2
Such a trite film.  Again with the jump scares and the shadows that bump in the night.  Smh! Give me something fresh.,0
Whats that music? Anyone please?,1
"for certain types, getting a little taste of power always escalates out of hand",0
"The soundtrack was a bit too Hollywood for me, what with the lowkey BWAAAMPS -  the rest however looks really promising. Excited.",2
Its :penguin:time.,1
"This actually looks pretty cool! My only nitpick is, I wish he had a prosthetic nose, I know it might look silly, maybe they decided it was too silly for such a serious series but I just know penguin for his deformities that makes him inherently looked down on by society, it just adds that extra layer of him wanting to be accepted and in this case, admired.",2
This is what dc is. Dark gritty and my god the tone is immaculate. So glad its form Matt reeves and not Gunn. Would have been kookily corny and filled with jokes.,2
Hes channeling Russell Crowe....not as a character...the real Russell Crowe...who is probably this psycho or more.,1
"If it doesnt have a flying cow, its not a true sequel",1
"Ooh, this looks good!",2
"Another piece of American garbage whose mission is to promote homosexuals at all costs.  Im sorry Americans, but your shows and movies are getting worse and worse.",0

No one asked for this,0
Teaser was more fun. Trailer feels bit more drama sad.:grinning_face_with_sweat:,0
another garbage movie lol,0
Im sooo excited for this.,2
"Now finally everyone can enjoy 100 Years... without all that pesky effort! All we had to do was remove the most enjoyable part of the experience, reading Marquezs prose! Yay!",2

They already did a remake ?!,1
Im so upset his husband is vanilla. But.. tale as old as time I guess. Weather its a straight or gay relationship.,0
If this would have had the cinematography (including scope format) just like the movie.. damn.. But still looks great.,2
This looks like an M. Night Shyamalan film that is actually going to be good! Hahaha jk Im instantly on board with anything Halle Berry!,2
Sobbing. Cool. Noteddd,2
I love trailers that are so confusing,2
LOTR please,1
Is this movie where B loses his voice?,1

This looks promissing . Lets hope it will be more horror oriented than action.,2
Good Trailer :clapper_board:,2
why DC stand-alone movies are doing g8 while the universe is still in a coma !!???,2
"I thought the title of this movie sounded familiar. This must be an American remake of the original Danish film, which only came out 2 years ago. The movie has one of the most gut-wrenching endings in a movie.",1
"Hmm, If I had to bet, the mom is suffering from something and from that it manifests itself into so called creatures but arent really true...hmmm",1
"Hi, May I share the most important news you will ever hear in your life? God the Father sent His holy Son Jesus Christ(Yshua Ha Mashiach) from heaven to earth, to be born of a virgin. He grew up and died on the cross for our sins.  He was put into a tomb for 3 days, and then Abba Father raised Jesus to life and He appeared to people and went back to Heaven.  We must all sincerely receive Jesus to be a true child of God.  It says in John 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. Will you genuinely believe on Christ Jesus and truly receive Him today, before it is too late?",1
Thought it was conan o brien for a moment,1
"Well, I gotta say, this trailer got me interested in the movie.",2
Please be good like first film or game alien isolation,2

Ohh its good,2
"I watched this in Berlin and loved it! A great step up from Luz for the director and he stays true to his style of the disturbing, unsettling, and intense. Like Luz, it will not be for everyone, even among horror enthusiasts. But this is what horror should be about (unlike Immaculate which is just basic bs imo).",2
"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO...Best of lucks, but no. that book is sacred.",0
Interesting take on the original. Not running away from them but going for them to destory them. This looks the best disaster movie in years.,2
I am already invested and will be horrified if there isnt a happy ending.,0
When does this come out,1
Why is Timon and Pumba in this ??,1
"Original storyline, possible attraction/ love story between the male and female storm chaser and the intensity of storm chasing makes this a good movie to see! Cant wait for it to be released in theaters!  I missed out on watching Twister the first time in theaters in the summer of 1996. Im saving my money up to see Twisters in theaters in July!",2
Wow Coleman is manifesting something huge :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::face_with_open_mouth: its beautiful to witness,2
Loved the Leifeld Just Feet shop,2
I rated is low and thumbs down on Netflix because no offense it was just white people annoying a lot of black people with their broken families and bad morals.,0
"A biker gang with Bane, General Zod and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen sounds terrifying…",1
Watch out for fire ants,1
So the premise is that he is the killer right? Not the twist?,1
I better hear them rocking out to some Van Halen Humans Being at some point or I will be extremely disappointed.,0
The title gets my attention,2
The Harley Davidson factory better start cranking out some vintage style bikes ASAP because I could see this movie bringing back an obsession for OG motorcycles. Theyre sitting on a potential gold mine. The Bikeriders and Furiosa are my two most anticipated films of 2024!,2
Pan Head Iron Head SOUNDS,1
This is worth going back to theaters for :raising_hands:,2

"Worldbuilding like this, and you know the Batman saga will be amazing and long lasting.",2
Who makes these trailers? Does anyone need to see the movie after watching that??,0
I assume Halle Berry is just crazy and overbearing and the world didnt actually end. Would have been a better trailer if they removed the part where the kids are doubting her.,0
Fede Alvarez is who you should have called years ago… This LOOKS like a Great Alien movie. Lets Gooo…,2
Name of the music used on this trailer please.. just beautiful.,2
Edited by Jake Roberts... Lets go!,2
why colonel aureliano buendia kinda...,1
Are they doing an Old Man Logan kinda thing where hes responsible for getting everyone else killed?,1
Seems worth checking out.,2
Finally! I cant wait!,2
Ive already seen this movie. Its a remake of a Swedish movie I think. Literally scene for scene. Good for the writer of the movie. Make that money!,2
Well trailer and movie would have been better if they didnt put 90% of the plot in the trailer again,0
Hartnett should play Harvey Dent,1
The twist ending in this trailer alone is better than any twist in a movie since The Sixth Sense!,2
"But we may lose our fantasized situations and locations of our own imagination and the beauty of varied ecstacy of magical realism for ever..We shall be limited to single frames of the serial hitherto:face_with_open_mouth:For example- in my innerviews, the firing squad thus in the first sentence donot have individual faces  or rather they were blurred to icy frames, which made the theme more grammatical to what the author had seen through his eyes ...",1

As I was watching the trailer I thought I cant wait for Josh Harnett to be the Butcher. Yup.,2
Mom says we have A24 at home.,0
I am so down for this The Batman Saga is somthing I have been dying for I just really hope they take care of it and dont over saturate it do to its popularity.,2
Another dumpster fire sequel that no one asked for because writers cant come up with original ideas. Hard pass,0

It takes a lot of courage to put such a masterfully written book on screen.,2
Wow! The trailer alone is riveting. I will definitely be heading to theaters to see this one!,2
This movie was already made 2x,0
"Look... I have nothing against gays or anything. But this show had a lot, and I mean a LOT more gay elements than the trailer made it seem to be. Perhaps Netflix should remember straight people are still the majority, and gay scenes will always be awkward af for anyone whos not gay. Sorry",0
Im reading this right now :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
"I CANNOT imagine North American movies will allow this movie to end the way the original did, and if it doesnt, what on earth is the point.",0

Thought Halle was going to be homeless in this :grinning_squinting_face:,1
"i got the chills twice watchin the preview,...mannnn",2
"Seems nice, but i think the reason the book is truly unadaptable has nothing to do with the events but the prose itself. As it is written in a way that is itself a summary of periods with highlights on certain events. Similar as to when a relative tells you a story from the family history.",1
Shes back.......,1
Norman Reedus !!!!!,2
Meanwhile Im just here scrolling between scary things and DRAGON BALL Z …. Ill stick with ANIME :face_with_tears_of_joy:,1

That glued on mustache,0
People in comments: no one cares about thisreality: they will be in the Cinema queue to see it on release,2
"The clips from the clemency hearing show how good the acting is. When is talking at  it could be a real interview, just natural acting. And then the sudden disappointment / fear on hearing the question so are you acting now Just magnificent acting",2
Since I watch the transformers rise  of the beasts and now Im watching the new transformers one until it comes out,1
Im kinda sold how about yall?,2
A24 once again telling interesting stories about unique and under-represented people. This is what makes them legendary,2
"You were supposed to release this trailer April 1st, Paramount. Now the jokes ruined.",0
I was excited but this one looks like absolute trash,0
Wished he didnt show the part that he is the villain,0

I hope it continues the story from where the last one left off,1
Butler wd be a fine pick to play Johnny Depp in the Depp biopic thats bound to come down the pike,2
First,1
I guess they dont want to build a snowman...,0
Cant go wrong with Tom hardy and Norman reedus,1
This reminds me of one of my favorite shows and director/writer of my favorite film of all time along with Charlie Kaufman of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind called Kidding (I hated that it was only 2 seasons because it got my past Fentanyl withdrawal throwing up and almost dying if not for my wife after 6 days and nights awake and then getting staph pneumonia and congestive heart failure along w a UTI and dying naked in my apt hallway for all to see)  There was something about those puppets like a shitty daytime kids show like Will You Be My Neighbor or Jim Henson that mixed with amazing authentic dialogue made me weep especially feeling everything sober but not really sober yet just dying from detox so hallucinating and completely dehydrated but w no alcohol involved at the time,2
Who do these idiots feel the urge to remake a good movie? :face_with_tears_of_joy: It hasnt been two years yet since the original Danish version. Now that was a good movie without obvious things like the kid telling the girl about his tongue like this. That movie was haunting. This one already feels… prostituted. I guess well see.,0
"Austin Butler, Tom Hardy and OF COURSE, Norman Reedus, the king of bikes! Tell me that Keanu will be there as well, PLEASE!",2
This looks good. Hope it lives up to the original.,2
Ima go watch Stone before this comes out,1
The original is amazingggg,2
I dont know...,1
Its Benedict. Hes the antagonist.,1
Why no diversity?,0
What the hell… its like a middle schooler saw a quiet place and wanted to make something similar…. How the hell a rope suppose to keep the evil away from u? Thhis dont even make sense,0
Ready for these 3 greats!!,2
I didnt even notice this until someone pointed it out. But at  you can see Cassandra in the scene watching them go through the portal.,1
I think I may go to the theaters for this one.,2

For the movie Austin butler dont get bald in dune 2. Instead hi prefer prosthetic:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,1
This aint it at all,0
the instrumental is phenomenal,2
Damn this looks really fucking good,2
"I didnt think it was possible, but now I want to see this movie even more than I did before!",2
I hope this movie picks up after covenant,1
Shouldnt it be called coocoo,1
Omg dont let them mess it up. The book is a treasure!!,0
I still cant believe thats Colin Ferrell. Thats the most tranformative roll i think Ive seen.,2
Old Transformers is best :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,2
In the world of M. Night Shyamalan ... is this adding to his cinematic universe? :eyes:,1
The vibe is already everything Id hoped itd be,2
Interesting :face_with_open_mouth:I still miss the old movie.Universal Theme Park had the Twister ride that was fun :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: brought back memories :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
In 2024 Mufasa probably has pronouns and identifies as something :grinning_face_with_sweat:,0
Im actually scared of Matt Reeves Batman Verse being better than the DCU upcoming Batman,1
"Can someone please tell me which book you are all talking about? The language of the book seems to be Sanskrit, am I right?",1
We live in a world where humans loves watching evil movies about themselves,0
another banger,2
Shouldve animated a Mufasa story,0
Seeing the trailer looks like getting a new toy as a child.,2
My boi shadow the hedgehog is going to beat mufasa off the box office cliff,1
"looks rly promising but damn... why does the Trailer show so much.. i feel like i watched the whole Movie.,",0
This story has already been told; its called The Missing,0
PLEASE...SOMEONE...what music/track is that? :pleading_face:,2
Oh no! Another movie with bad Chicago accents!,0
Transformers fans assemble,1
I have always believed that Marquezs magical realism cannot be translated into cinema. I hope Netflix doesnt ruin it. The trailer looks interesting though.,2
All of my yes,2

Ive seen more facial expressions in GoldenEye 64,0
Based on the Chicago Outlaws,1
Coleman Domingo is a force,2
Where is norman :face_with_open_mouth:,1
I havent been this excited for A Marvel movie in years. Looks great!,2
WHY USE BAD CGI IF YOU CANT PASS IT AS BELIEVABLE.,0
theyve done it. That 70 oldskool horror vibe the filters and the color grades they use nailed. When I was a kid I was scared by those types of horror movies It was the 70 that made me eerie but the movies from now look too clean and much CGI. But this brings me back to my memories and define linty Im gonna watch this movie master piece.,2
This looks really good,2
This movie is so Offensive and extremely disgusting mentality of these ppl.not a single White person in screen. Such a raciest movie. These ppl always want and help same color only.Its such a horrible mentality. I am Disgusted by this,0
Well I am more interested in action movies only,1
Trailer it self terrifying. This would be good.,2
Matt Reeves the Batman saga is my favorite franchise in dc history,2
Im looking forward to this :raising_hands_medium-light_skin_tone:,2
the film grain sucks,0
Why....  ?? Hollywood lost their ideas. Always remakes,0
Great! :red_heart::fire:,2
The concept of the movie is great. The execution not so much,0
"OMG!!!!! This is so ! It is soooo refreshing to see a strong woman that dont need no man in the lead role of one of these Alien movies. Its just so great that the cast is so diverse, so diverse in fact that no white men are allowed! And the body positivity on display is amazing, she didnt work out at all for the role. In fact, it would have been amazing if they cast Lizzo as the lead!",0
No more remakes please.  People are tired of it all.,0
This series about to go hard,2
"Welcome, my rice cooker...",2
"Anybody else hate the modern trend of cutting up great songs in movie trailers? Either play the song (which doesnt need your help being good) or write your own thing, but dont ruin ABBA with Inception BWWAAAs. Its lazy and tasteless.",0
Havent been to see a movie since before covid. Will be first in line :grinning_face_with_sweat:,2
It looks pretty good but Im getting Spiderman villain solo film vibes,2
I hope we see Bishop and ripley,1
Loving this for Coleman Domingo!,2

finaly !!!,2
Please be good. Then do the same with predator,1
This actually looks good. I hope it is.,2
another oscar worthy performance,2
Definitely going to watch this !,2
Looks interesting but definitely a movie Ill watching though my fingers lol,2
Yet another movie where I cant understand a single word (allegedly in English) coming out of Tom Hardys mouth. Last time I did was Inception I think.,0
Why do I get Sopranos feeling. I cant wait!!!!,2
Enough of the prison bs,0
"completely uninteresting. Hollywood it seems, cannot produce an original idea anymore. Its formula for failure these days is to apparently puke back up tired. old plot lines with ever increasing levels of absurd CGI. Then they trumpet it as ground breaking and that we should all go waste money and time to see it. Sort of like p-$ing upon ones head and calling it rain.",0
I really hope this goes into supernatural territory with the monster actually being conjured up and using brutal means to find the child.,1
It kinda looks like they made the same movie again,0
I read that the cast is full of formerly incarcerated actors. Thats amazing. Cant wait to see this,2
"Dan Stevens is getting all the recognition he deserves! Such a great actor :red_heart:Also, Hunter :red_heart::red_heart:",2
Lopks great.,2
"Can we give Coleman Domingo an Oscar on Saturday for his performance in this, even though we dont know the release date yet?",1
"This is why I love DC, a superhero show that looks like proper prestige TV.",2
I watched the danish one awhile back and it was brutal… this is gonna be just as great. If it ends the same way ughhhhhh so sad,2
Why the bad language in a kids animated movie?  I really wanted to see this with my kid but now I cannot....very sad,0
Thanks for 1.56k subscribers :red_heart::party_popper:,1

Whos here for that nice silhouette,1
This was the immediate thought i had when i watched the batman movie. I would loove to see more of colin farrells Penguin,2
He looks like Conor McGregor in that thumbnail lol,1
lmao why? just watch the original!!,0
Anyone notice the ear piece at ?,1
what the f*ck is it with holding guns at the waist like Rambo? Do these directors know nothing?!,0
Yawn...kinda sad whats happened to the mighty Disney,0
Theres nothing better to see than humans recovering their souls. Thats why one reason why I love being a Christian.,2
Have loved everything I have read by Gabriel García Márquez...the adaptation of El Amor en el Tiempo del Cholera was disappointing. I hope they do this one justice.,2
Seeing him with a few extra pounds of muscle and the way his hair is. He could totally be Russell Crowe in Gladiator.,2
You cant leave anything alone can you ? You have to crap on everything .,0
Not the biggest of horror fans but this actually looks pretty good,2
Colman Domingo is an extraordinary actor of our time,2
I may be the last Buendia....,1
Ive always been a fan of James. Definitely the best actor of his generation. Hes criminally underrated.,2
Who is the dude playing Gretchen?,1
i didnt want to finish the trailer.. cant wait to watch,2
WHEN DOES IT COME OUT :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
Great trailer. Doesnt seem to give most away and subtly hints at things that suggests this is not all what it seem to be,2
 your soul is gone if you cant feel anything at this point in the trailer.,2
Whats wrong with creativity????   (or the lack of),0
Benedict Cumberbatch is on :fire: :fire:,2
 Thats Ant Man right there? It means theyre gonna bring Deadpool & Wolverine to the MCU. Imagine Wolverine & Doctor Strange leading the Avengers now..Yeah baby!,2
I genuinely hope DC realizes the opportunity they have here. To tell a Sopranos type story in the setting of GOTHAM ***** CITY! This can be a banger if they treat it well,2
55 years old man playing Wolverines :face_holding_back_tears:,1
Nod to Half Life 2 with those jumping face-huggers?,1
"Ok, this idea was stolen from the movie Tethered. Dont know if it has the same ending but definitely borrowed the plot:face_with_open_mouth:",0
why they gotta remake everything? the originsl was great,0
"Oh, this looks HEAVY bro definitely a day one!",2
Meme worthy moment ,1
Fast and furious but with bikes,1
A killer cast on motorcycles is a MUST WATCH!!!,2
I loved this trailer cut:smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:,2
I was obsessed with Twister (1996) while growing up. Its so cool to see a whole new generation get to enjoy their own version of what i used to love.,2
The twist this time around is there is no twist.,1

The butcher comin kombucha,1
Peaky Blinders On Motorcycles,1
The twist is this whole movie is promoting his daughter career as a singer,1
Finally!! Sopranos season 7!,2
I just found out Hunter is trans. I had no idea. She is really lovely,2
Do you smell that? Thats the smell of a flaming dumpster filled with Shit.,0
Surprise surprise Netflix make sure to tick the recommended box :face_with_rolling_eyes:,2
"Marvel right now: :face_vomiting::face_vomiting:DC right now, somehow: :fire::fire::fire:",2
"I love when trailers focus more on conveying atmosphere than telling me the whole story sparks-notes style. Im far more likely to seek out a movie/tv series with a trailer like this. Well, this is the weekend sorted!",2
Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing in every project :red_heart:,2
"Im Happy 4 The Latino Community Rich Respectful Culture One Hundred Years Of Solitude , But The Black Community Gets  ------cartooned with Good Times = harmful & Racist Stereo Types",1

It would be nice if you put a plot synopsis in the description.,1
"how tf do you adapt this book to film? its my favorite book but by god, this is gonna be a feat if its pulled off",2
"Saw this movie at TIFF last year, it is wonderful",2
Nothing better in this world than when Halle loses some kids!,2
Good cast absolutely horrible tittle!,0
"Wow....  A lot of profanity in this trailer.  Im no prude, but Im surprised Marvel let all of these F bombs in the trailer.  I miss The Avengers",0
Hes reading Hindi?!,1
Storyline between alien and aliens perhaps….  The story of the terraformers before comms were lost with lv-426?,1
SB commercial here I am.,1
James McAvoy looks a bit like Russell Crowe,1
Wasnt this meant to come out in December,1
Mr. Shyamalan doesnt always stick the landing but at least he always tries something new. This looks very promising!,2
"Definitely gonna watch it, just wish they put a few of the original cast in as a cameo. Alan Ruck, Todd Field, Lois Smith, Jeremy Davies etc... RIP Bill and Philip.",2
"One of these days Tom Hardy gotta play a role where he speaks normally without doing a funny voice. Its always distracting. Austin Butler is really blowing up these days. And its easy to see why. Hes a great actor and just a cool dude, with that James Dean vibe. The movie looks good! Im in!",2
What is this lame-ass shit?,0
"I watched it at the Berlinale, absolutely insane film, unique visuals with such an interesting horror film concept. I really enjoyed it and you should watch it if you can!",2
i cried and this is just the trailer... man cant wait for this movie to release!!!,2
Rockstar Games Presents:Cuckoo,1
"Is it me, or does optimus sound like sonic in some parts (I know its chris Hemsworth but still",1
The magical realism :red_heart:,2
Ok so thanks to the trailer we know how the entire movie plays out. Just need to skip to the last 20 minutes to see who dies and who escapes :thumbs_up:,0
"Its very rare to see Hollywood actually make a good CG tornado, from the looks of this trailer, this movie exceeds those visual expectations",2
That plot twist was crazy,2
R.I.P Bill Paxton Twister is my 1 of top 2 movies ever I hope it lives up to the original! :flexed_biceps_medium-dark_skin_tone:,2
Why did Disney drop this film when the people who watched it in festivals love it?,1
Im already ugly crying bruh,2
Am I just watching a trailer for another version of Happy?? :thinking_face:,1

So basically Bird box mix with quiet Place hereditary us And saw,1
I love James McAvoy but this movie seems like its going to be absolute shit that not even he can save,0
Ive never been so completely disappointed in a movie before. Thanks Chris.,0
Amazing how they can spoil the twist inside the trailer.,0
Twister was in 1996 and the graphics/effects were ahead of its time. One of the best action movies of the 90s and I remember getting the VHS and being super excited. Watched it so many times.,2
this is funny and awesome for 3 year olds,2
"God Disney, ur  rand now is messing up easy money. Star Wars, doctor who, marvel and so on.For the love of god dont F this up",0

Shes Easily in my top 10 actors of all time,2
"Looks like  just another Avatar movie trailer. Really hope they managed to take something more out of this book than to feed this scriptwriting crisis, oversimplify everything and add a couple of cgi scenes",0
Parody of The Sopranos. This is creative impotence,0
A24 once again telling interesting stories about unique and under-represented people. This is what makes them legendary,2

Yeah will skip this one,0
I was always more of a Vargas Llosa Fan myself,1
I read this book years ago im happy its getting adapted i hope they adapt les rougon macquaret next,2
Colombian masterpiece. Cant wait to watch,2
"imagine if this was a 2d animated movie. Wouldve easily won back the people, Disney clearly has no idea about what they are doing",0
Wait so is this going to be based on alien isolation? Because I just kinda get that vibe.,1
So goood!!! BTW: Haters run out of data plans?? No internet? Whatever happened to Disney is gonna ruin Alien? In Fede we trust!,2
Mmmmmm… Definitely not what I was hoping for.,0
"Copy rarely better than original, same thing happened with excellent French horror movie Martyrs. Original was very good, Hollywood remake is barely watchable.....",0
Awesome trailer... Now we just have to wait for NewRockstars and ScreenCrush to break it all down,2
ok this looks horrifying !!! James McAvoy is SUCH a great actor ! bloody creepy bloody dr !,2
Is there a flying cow though,1
The car was moved by the storm but they are running wow,2
You cant recreate perfection.Then went for attractive instead of interesting with this cast looks like. This will bomb.,0
It will be my best gift.,1
thats how you do a trailer,2
Scoot will upstage James in this. Kick ass actors,2
Obviously Vincent killed his own son. The clues are there.,1
The Main Antagonist Is Momma,1

I couldnt continue reading after Melquaides disappearance :crying_face:,0
this is incredible,2
Was sold as soon as I saw Cristin Milioti,2
Color me impressed.  Looks funny and its going to cover the whole origin story of just about everything..,2
Cant wait to see this!!!,2
Im not some like woke activist or anything I just gotta say its pretty cool to see a transgender actor just playing a regular role in a regular movie and not just a movie about being trans. Reminds me of Night of the Living Dead (1968) that starred a Black dude in a movie that had nothing to do with race and wasnt targeted towards Black audiences.,2
Does the cgi look worser or is it just me,0
This may be the last good thing we get from Marvel! PLEASE :folded_hands_medium_skin_tone: PLEASE :folded_hands_medium_skin_tone: PLEASE :folded_hands_medium_skin_tone: dont mess this up!,2

Finally got something to watch in big screen :party_popper::party_popper::flexed_biceps:,2
May 3rd is the release date since for some reason they left it out,1
Im your Uncle Buck,1
It could be even better if it wasnt a comedy but still looks cool,2
Hollywood just mostly sucks nowadays.,0
Finally trailer comes,2
september? why so hurry?,1
Gonna be so good fede is perfect for this,2
Finally!,2
wait a minute.  why does this look like recycled garbage?,0
Wow those hallways look just like Alien: Isolation! Fede Alvarez look like he is about to kill it again. Love his directing style and emphasis on sheer terror. This is gonna be so gooood.,2
Saw this already….love the cast but the OG didnt need re-telling,2
This is most likely going to be the best movie of the summer.,2
The route that Austin is taking since Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is superbly traced and it gives so much more meaning to his career to see him in a biker film like this which suits him well. With Elvis he was on the verge of winning the Oscar but there will be no doubt that he will win the Oscar either with The Bikeriders as best leading role or with Dune 2 as best supporting role.,2
Is this going off of any comics or anything just curious if I remember correctly didnt quintessa(dont know if I spelled it right) make Optimus ? Also this looks like an okay movie but I can see most not watching it because of it being animated.,1
Tom Hardy is becoming the Kanye West of acting. Hes just sampling peoples voices. Im hearing Mike Tyson in this one.,0
"Imo, the colour should be brighter and ambience should felt magical. Now, maybe theyve managed to do these things in real series. Lets see, what happens..",2
"Wow this touched my soul....the Abba song so beautiful, fantastic trailer",2
is this a Remake or a Different Story??,1
Coleman Domingo and A24? Say no more.,1
My favorite thing about this trailer is the comments praising the trailer for being made well. Finally movie trailers are done the way they are supposed to be.,2
"I was really hoping for more on the engineers and the lure. Maybe a less campy history around predators, xenomorphs, blade runner, engineers, and space jockeys. There is so much depth in this universe.",1
Nolan cinematrography but horror,1
Back to basics.  I like it.,2
This actually looks pretty great.,2
I WANT TO SEE IT,2
This feels like this was partially inspired by the disappearance of Etan Patz,1
Please.please please.hurry up so I can watch this,2
But I did see online somewhere pictures that the son does come back home.,1
Me just waiting to be disappointed :waving_hand_medium-dark_skin_tone:,0
"Can I just say this is a perfect example of how you do a  teaser trailer. For an Alien film Youre not getting a synopsis of the entire film. But it perfectly gives you the setting, and vibe. Thats a Teaser Trailer right there.",2

I loved halle Barry in The call (2013). Excited to see this :star-struck:,2
"The Penguin, another money machine!",2
Why do they keep making these movies?,0
If it produce by stranger things I would definitely watch this,2
Shawshank redemption Part 2,1
This feels like Beyonce forcing them to make this so Blue Ivy can be in a movie.,1
They went from not having any good xmen to having THE x man,2
Why do they remake the same movies?,0
"Lol, well Dr.Strange looks like he MIGHT be in this. Or Wong...",1

Sorry but my kids are 18 and I still dont even allow them to walk to the mailbox by themselves without monitoring them through my cameras.  I feel very sorry for kids who must walk to school unaccompanied!! My parents always drove us to school and I did the same with mine. My kids are too precious for me to allow anything to happen to them.,1
Whats the delay? Supposed to be out 2023 I think I was told.,1

"Good : The mood is awesome, sci-fi elements works great according to timeline, sounds and visuals are top notch even with this ultra compressed low quality video.Not good : The characters arent interesting, same look & feel as Ripley we already saw in both Alien/Aliens (déjà vu). Look like a copy-paste, come on!",2
"Did you know movie lovers. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life throught Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:23 You and I broke the law and Jesus paid the fine.

Another show that will run for 1) 1 season and get cancelled on a cliffhanger; 2) 2 seasons, but the second sucks and gets cancelled on a cliffhanger; 3) 3-4 seasons, and they rush the ending.

Worst casting of all time,0
Halle Berry is truly one of 1!! The range she possesses!! Like seriously!! From B.A.P.S to Catwoman to Losing Isiah to X-men to Dorothy Dandridge to Monsters Ball to Gothika to The call to Bruises etc none of the roles are the same! Shes extraordinary!!

"Yes I like benedict cumberbatchs acting. He done great works. He will be great in this. I see nothing online showing any c proff there was ever a boy named Eric or monster. Icthink its a made up story.some things in it might have happened. Only I  see no truth yet that this boy existed or was even real. Based on a true story then whos it based on.better if its not true. Theres articles saying its a true story in different ways.I would rather have more Sherlock Holmes, this I dont believe is In that league. I probably will watch DEAD BOY DETECTIVES. I dont know if ill watch Eric yet I can not find enough true information to watch a storyline of a missing child",2

Another great a24 film :smiling_face:,2
Yes and thank you.,2
"Dude.  Im thinking this is gonna be epic. Kind of like the Joaquin Pheonix JOKER movie was, but different.  This looks more like THE SOPRANOS meets Batman. :slightly_smiling_face: I love it when villians get their own movies (or in this case, TV series).",2
"Ruining another classic, try making something original.",0

Im here for the director tbh,2
"I dont expect too much from Netflix. As usual ( like AppleTV and Amazon Prime), they wont be able to resist distorting the original work by trying to be politically correct and adding the same minorities over and over again to avoid offending certain lobbies.",0

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Didnt they put Wolverine in his headgear????,0

Finally my origin story...,2
Kind of having a feeling like if your husband  cheats and you are hoping so much he would change!!!!! Scared to feel optimistic right now but this actually looks great :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
It actually looks very interesting. Most horror movies lately have been so corny. This is like a mix of the Grudge and The Hills Have Eyes,2
that is the worst fake scream ive seen on television.,0
this years Toni Collette in Hereditary; Florence Pugh in Midsommar; Lupita Nyongo in Us & Mia Goth in Pearl great performance but gonna snub at the awards season,1
Id love to see the Batman 2 with Black mask or Bane working for Penguin then gets in a gang war with Scarecrow as king off the drop heads with Hush working alongside Scarecrow then bring 2 Face Hugo Strange and Joker into part 3.,2
Colin Farrell never had the makings of a varsity athlete...,1

Cast isnt diverse enough,0
Disney is pathetic af nowadays :face_with_tears_of_joy: Who asked for this ? :grinning_squinting_face:,0
Atleast they got his desolate air and eyes of solitude right.,2
Halle Berry is back in movies!! Yesss!!,2
tbh i dont expect this to be good in fact there is no good movie after the endgame this is just like spider man 3 which just completes the deadpool series after all they talked about another multiverse nonsense:unamused_face:,0
Mike Epps should be proud.,2
"I love that he basically has the same motivation as Danny DeVitos Penguin, just to be loved and respected.",2
I love this! The humor and style reminds of pre Endgame MCU films! I cant wait!,2
Ill watch anything with Hunter in it. :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart: I cant wait. I love her so much.,2

"I thought Andy serkis should of been cast as penguin and not Alfred, boy Im now eating my words",2
This looks fantastic!,2
Something to look forward to.  Ill definitely see this in theaters.,2
This is crazy one of the best books Ive read is getting live action?!  Im thrilled :party_popper::red_heart::fire:,2

Hubbys a wussy,1
Cant wait! I adored the book :smiling_face_with_hearts:,2
Ill watch anything with Bandolier Cumberbund.,1
Non-Hispanic audiences dont realize how big of a deal this project is. 100 years of solitude is one of the most if not the most important piece of latinamerican literature in history. It is of utmost importance that Netflix gets this right.,2
"Please be good, please be good, please be good.",2
"Didnt expect to be this good, a must see drama movie that isnt nowhere near the mainstream drama, and its a true story.",2
Whats this trash:face_with_tears_of_joy:,0
The New Bird Box.,1
This looks like they made the first movie again but without the fun and charm. I hope Im wrong.,0
"Finally a movie with a male lead, for once",2
The book is a must read. They nailed the vibe with all the colors,2
"Ohhh brother, this guy stinks!!",0
Another boring Halle Berry movie :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_rolling_eyes:,0
"So I just saw the movie, not bad!",2
Music is Too Good,2
"Ima be very honest, first when I seen  the black guy and who he was and with and ect I was irritated, all because I feel like they are pushing this agenda on everybody. Cartoons,movies ect…. But ,I said let me keep going, this series was understanding and had me tearing up. I get it! I really do.",0
this is either gonna be really good or really bad lol but i hope its good!!,2
"Now THATS how you hype up a show. You get the feel of it and the intensity of it without showing everything.  Plus, its clearly in the Batman universe without question. Well done.",2
JOSH HARTNETT IS BACK IM SO HAPPY OMG,2
The audience are either going to be disgusted or fascinated by the movie lol......,1
Dan Stevens loves playing a freaky little guy.,1
This actually looks kind of terrifying,0
Put that money in an Alien Isolation sequel and stop with the bad movies. The last good one was in the 80s for god sake,0
"Please let me spoil this for you!!! The original movie is soooo traumatizing but it has such a deep meaning, almost nothing bad can happen to you if you take control of your destiny. How are you okay with someone feeding you chicken if youre a vegetarian? How are you letting a stranger put your daughter on a motorcycle and driving off when you JUST met them? These people test your limits little by little until they own you. When asked why? The antagonist only says cause you let me … CHILLS I TELL YOU!",2
Arlong and doctor strange nice,2
"I know people are complaining about how in serious the trailer makes the movie seem, but megs will have to fall out with Orion at some point in the movie, I dont know how kiddy you can make that.",1

The club.. is changing you.What in the Sons of Anarchy :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,2
I have exactly zero expectations because Im coping and hoping this is good.,2
I learned one thing! These women are absolutely nothing I already knew that but dang. Besides that the series was excellent loved it and we need more of this :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,2
so a black version of birdbox,1
This might be Sherlock origin story.,1
I love the first movie this is got to be better than it,2
I wasnt looking forward to this when there was mention of a new movie.. but getting an horror director to pump some fresh blood back into the franchise might just be an excellent idea. Reverting back to the original setting feels like such a great choice too. Keen!,2
Magical realism is finally coming alive on Netflix. Let us be honest that this story is beyond any human abilities to create it visually. But we should be thankful that someone is attempting it. My love and respect for the makers. Keenly awaiting.,2
This movie looks so good wtf,2
Shit makes me want to go to prison! Ha,1
Idk what in the Gothika Birdbox this is but Ill be tuning in.,2
I love it when movies are shot in my hometown! :Canada::star-struck:,2

I know the story no matter who plays I am never gonna watch it again.:crying_face: unless they change the ending... maybe I will.,0
This is giving me proper Movie vibes like something that wouldve come out pre-woke era definitely watching this in the cinema,2
Is it just me or does Cumberbatch looks kind of like Walter White in that thumbnail?,1

At least the spin off used the BEST ACTOR in that last movie where Batman cant fly :face_with_rolling_eyes:,1
"They need to get rid of Bob Iger, this is terrible.",0
"This movie is already exciting, I wish you success",2
"I swear to God, I STILL cannot see Colin Farrell under that makeup no matter how hard I squint. Probably one of the best makeup jobs in the history of cinema.",2
why are the lips tight when the ovipositor is being removed? that doesnt make sense. or are they trying to seggsualize alien.,0
"Ok i just saw1.- Ant man Skull rebuild as a cassandra novas base.2.- Red Skulls car from the first avenger movie.3.- TVA and Alioth from loki4.- Dr Stranges portal 5.- Lady Deathstrike, Pyro and AzazelAnd pretty raw fight between deadpool and logan. Im sold.",1

"Not everything that Netflix touches is bad. I will watch it and if I get disappointed, it will be perfectly fine. It wont be Netflix fault, it will be Gabo interfering from the afterlife saying, leave my masterpiece alone.",0
Mmmmboy does Colin Farrell look fat with that makeup. I hope they make Oz his own character and dont just make Tony Soprano in Gotham but otherwise I really like the look of this trailer. I was also hoping they would make Sofia look bigger but oh well…,2
Daryl Dixon in a movie about motorcycles. The perfect combination,2

I AM ROCK SOLID,2
"Ngl Chris Hemsworth works for a younger Optimus. I get it, though. We are all too used to peter cullen",2
Cant wait for this. I hope they roll The Batman into the new DCEU instead of the brave and the bold,2
Another neat twist would be if hes not this Butcher theyre looking for but someone actually waaaaaaaaaay worse.,1
If only theyd make a full movie using the art direction from the Bumblebee movie Cybertron scenes. But we get this instead. :face_with_rolling_eyes:,0

Im so hyped for this!!! More alien yay :fire::fire::fire:,2
Why not finish the prequel trilogy!,1

"Now this I absolutely gotta see, what a damn good trailer! I can also tell the director took very clear inspiration from The Shining with the way the scenes are shot, this totally came out of nowhere for me. I gotta keep a closer eye on this NEON company.",2
aw thts promising !,2

The drums kinda overhyped,0
Farrell is amazing :red_heart:From Russia with love :Russia:,2
This is my favorite book and I cant wait for the adaptation. But I also cant stop thinking about the fact that the manuscript being read in this video beginning seems to be a Hindi translation of One Hundred Years of Solitude!,2

Where will this be shown?? And when??,1
Okay Im hype but question does this take place before The Batman or After The Batman like a year later or something? Im actually confused,2

James McAvoy is such a great actor! He had me hooked in split!,2
"I dont think itll read as brutal as the original one because of the filming styles, its Hollywood blockbuster, and we already know what to expect but itll be interesting to see the differences in interpretation and Im sure itll be entertaining, James McAvoy and Mackenzie Davis seem like perfect choices",2
I thought is 20th Century Studios not focus pictures,1
Holy shit I am beyond sold.,2
Wondered why they needed to remake this. Then I realised.......:money-mouth_face::money-mouth_face::money-mouth_face:. This will defo not live up to the original. The special effects dont look any different. And will it have Van Halens superb music at the end? Doubt it.,0

"The stories from Sing Sing Prison have always captivated me, and I am beyond excited for this movie. Its been my dream to write a film about the production of the 1972 Thanksgiving show—something about prison and the blues pulls on the heart. This trailer promises the same exploration of humanity, the impossibility of it all and that fleeting feeling of triumph.",2
Jumping through those Dr strange portal things. Hell yeah,2
"Tom Hardy?-No, No, No only Norman Reedus",1

"Colin Farrell talented actor, he did so many good movies, definitely should had won atleast one time the best actor itw",2

"A little bit too lighthearted, but Im glad its not that Spider verse style fuzzy animation.  Hopefully this movie is entertaining at least and not just all for the kiddos.",2
Why does this seem like a straight rip from another movie?,0

Omg! This movie is everythink!,2

"Neon, A24, and Blumhouse running the cinema game right now.",2
I remember seeing Twister at the drive-in back in the day :smiling_face_with_tear:,2
How tf would the feds know hes there though?,0
Looks more like we are getting a The Village style twist to me. I think that Halle is crazy and hiding the kids from the normal world.,1

"The monster is a depiction of his dad. There was no need to create the monster, as the monster was already created",1
Shyamalan always focuses on building trust with a character only to make him/her the most sinister person of the plot.,1
"no need to watch the movie, the trailer shows the whole story -_-",0
Could this be the film in which Cumberbatch finally nails an American accent?,2

"Im going to see this, for sure, but why do these movie people think that this is how it works? You dont make a standalone villain movie... you make another Batman movie where he has to fight the Penguin again.",2
Nobody cares about Joe Biden :face_with_tears_of_joy:,0
Neon and A24 do the best stuff honestly. Hollywood just peddles out the same recycled shit for braindead slasher enthusiasts. This looks amazing,2
Getting a horror team on an Alien movie is a mistake.,0
Why does tom hardy sound like david beckham? Sounds like he inhaled helium lol,0

Seems like a BETTER version of the film TETHERED.,2
I am glad that they have dramatised the famous first line of the book in this teaser. :red_heart:,2
I figured they made this because people dont wanna read subtitles anymore even if the original is better hell there loads of horror movies made into English and sucked the only saving grace is James in this other then that it like how jaws 3 was watchable because of Dennis Quaid,0
I always liked him in fear the walking dead.,2

Why you gotta wreck the 4runner tho,0
Netflix making movies based on novels is not a good thing for historical literature. It will ruin this masterpiece. Lets hope Netflix wont add unnecessary woke political agenda in this. Lets hope I am wrong.,0
I really dont believe anyone can convey the depth of this book in a movie. Ive read it so many times in both Spanish and English that I simply cant believe its possible.,0
"For an origin story, this looks like a lot of fun!  Im in!",2
Looks fantastic,2
"This looks really good. My only criticism is that the font they used for the title makes it look Friends, and really cant believe no one in the marketing department noticed this. Seriously, all I thought when I saw the screenshot of the three characters with Twisters underneath them was Friends.",2
Ahhh Gabby Hoffman.,2
"I think this will get the top 3 spot of best Alien movies, right below Alien & Aliens. Lets hope Im right.  Romulus becoming the 3rd best Alien movie is all we ask!!",2

I Cant Wait :red_heart::fire:,2
"I see Austin butler, i click is easy",2
Go Disney.... It dont have to have a good story as long as it has a lot of DEI in it. I cant wait to see some Alien twerking and LGBTQ facehugger action.,2
Well we are missing CHARLIE HUNNAM here,0
I would prefer anna taylor joy for that role but movie looks great tho,2
Whats remarkable about this movie is that many of the actors featured actually were formerly incarcerated at Sing Sing and participated in their arts program.,2
Nah victor I see you.,2
So they bring back Beyoncé but NOT JAMES EARL JONES yea hard pass….,0
Hmm. Why not. Im always up for an origin prequel for the hero and villains. Especially the rivalry between two of the most iconic robots in pop culture.,2

"I was just about to cut this trailer short, when I choked on my coffee and had to get it together....Which means I had to watch the rest of it with tears in my eyes, struggling to breathe...and now I wanna see it...Cant wait to see it:orange_heart::purple_heart::orange_heart:",2
why does this movie look like its filmed cheap like is it just me or is it a higher framerate or something maybe the cinematography it doesnt feel like a warner bros production,0
Im definitely going to see this,2
I swear if it turns out the mom is just crazy Ill be disappointed. I hope we get to see some cool new creatures.,1
Animals have come a long way in their acting ability.,2

How many cartels will be featured in this movie?,1
Ive been wanted to read this for a long time,2
Its another copy and paste movie made by the Hollywood  Ive run out of ideas directors.  This movie will fail due to no originality.  They are copying the exact scenes and scripts from the original Twister movie using really bad unknown actors and actresses.   Im sure the Gen-X and  Gen-Z will love it until they see the original Twister movie.,0
What a neat and artistic trailer. I cant wait to see this!,2
Does the hay black cops geriatric lover ultimately add to the plot or was that scene just thrown on for kicks?,1

So Kevin got married now.,1
She is one of my favorite actresses. She has got talent for sure.,2
"i dont know if i should be really happy, or extremely angry about a sequel for twister. The original twister was just a classic movie. Please i pray that this isnt just a watered down soulless studio version of the original, trying to rake in money on nostalgia without thinking about the impact the movie has had on its philosophy, storytelling, the feel, the music, its brilliant actors and science.The movie was important to science. the original  inspired a great deal of folks to become meteorologists, storm chasers, and physics enthusiasts. A lot of the vernacular people use in storm-chasing today was brought on by it. Please Im begging. please let this movie not be some cashgrab.",0

ARCADIAN Nicholas Cage does a better job with drama than this.",0
"Dan Stevens is back and I will watch this for him, even though I dont watch horror",2

"Never cared about The Batman so really dont care about this. Wish you all could just focus on one, cohesive universe but it is what it is. Colin Farrell will probably eat this up tho like he does everything hes in.",0

Cant wait for this to drop! Excellent song choice too lol. It fits very well xD.",2
Ive been waiting for this since it got announced in 2019! 5 long years! LESSSSSSGOOOO!,2
"My only reservation is that Ridley Scott said this was good.  And given how egotistical he is, if this movie were actually better than his crappy prequel films, he seems like the person that would be butthurt and petty about it, so Im just not sure yet.",0
this is the movie that  im gonna watch in the cinema,2
a24 with more dogshit.,0
Im gonna pay for every single post Thanos MCU (not Spiderman) movie that I missed.,2

Im so excited my chest is going to burst of hype,2
"Its so funny to me how many Boomer movies are coming out this year. Theres this (which is essentially Easy Rider), another Tom Hanks WWII movie thats just Saving Private Ryan in planes, and a long generic western from Kevin Costner.",1
Will Batman appear in this? I hope not,1
im just done with superhero movies. the humor and light is gone.,0
SHE IS FINAL GIRL ALREADY,1

"Isnt there already a movie like this, it came out like 2 years ago and is already in english. Why the remake?",0
"I think the Penguin ist one of the most boring comic villains. Hes a mobster, thats it. No special power, no charisma, just a sinister, ugly guy. But Colin Farrell did great in The Batman, so that this could become interesting",0
Another movie no one asked for. :unamused_face:,0
Ehhhhhh nothing will compare to the original.,0

"This trailer looks really awesome. Though I find it interesting on how theyre taking a direction with this movie as it seems like its not connect to the Knightverse due to the origin story being far different to the other origin story being vasty different the iconic backstory that other Transformers series follow. Along with Bumblebee appearing to be around the same age as Orion, Megatron and Elita one.",2
Is Neon the new A24?,2

James McAvoy or Gerard Butler?,1
...no voids were filled in the making of this show...,1
Whoa!! Is this a movie or TV series. One of my favorite novels ever but theres no way they can fit this into a movie length. It has to be a limited series. Maybe more than one season.,2
this looks like it was made on unity look at the tree whats up with those branches not that it matters im not going to watch it but its just funny because the trees dont look natural to me,0
Saw this at SXSW. Knocked my socks off. Colman Domingo could win an Oscar for this. And I predict itll be nominated for Best Picture.,2
"Holy cow, what happened to James mcavoy?  He sure bulked up.",1
Ill be able to watch this and not be so scared cos Im single :face_with_tears_of_joy:,2

you dont want actress mary elizabeth becoming the starring heroin in this film? guess it fits more the character in my thoughts.,0
"Interesting. I almost feel like him NOT being the killer would have been the more interesting stakes, since hed be trying to protect his daughter from a deranged killer hiding among millions of strangers. That feels more relatable and claustrophobic. But well see what happens.",1
James McAvoy is the best when it comes to playing such psycho charaters! LOL,2
"The original working title was The Cheese, for 12 year olds.",0
"The Shining in Alps resort.Cuckoo could be derived from term cuckoolander, hinting a psychological-terror twist.",1

Parece ser bom,1
"The first thing I see is that, as with most action movies these days, theyve gone a bit far on the action. Its too in your face right off the bat. Hopefully thats just the trailer and not how the movie will be, but it will be very hard for them to top the first movie.",0
The Beast strikes again. lol,2
I know a huge twist will blow our minds.,2
This looks like a nightmare!Why?????,0

The trailer tells me this woman is suffering from psychosis,1
"Oh my, oh my... This has written disaster all over the place. Whats the point of remaking an EXCELLENT movie that came out in 2022? Also, not only is the trailer is a total spoiler, but I can also see that in this American version they thought to put some fights scenes... how to destroy the eerie atmosphere and go full gringo mode...",0

Drop a trailerNEON: :smirking_face:,1
"This movie appears to have a distinct lack of likable characters. The first movie was an adventure about a group of likable and passionate storm chasing nerds. This thing comes across as a thriller without any humor in it. Im not blaming the actors, but the script for this was made my the guy who wrote The Revenant  (not exactly an upbeat film) with the help from the director of Top Gun Maverick, so... yeah... I guess were getting an over the top action thriller, not a fun humorous adventure. Im not blaming the cast, but none of the people in the cast are known for playing quirky and likable characters. I dont think it will bomb, but i expect to see a score of 5.5/10 maybe.",0
Please dont be a carbon copy of the first one. And please dont make any of the characters related to the ones in the previous,0

If it was an f5 that close to my house I probably wouldnt be typing this today.",1

I love 70s 80s aesthetic,2
"There better be a supernatural angle to this where the monster becomes real, sentient and hopefully with a demonic thirst for revenge on the wicked that feeds upon the kidnappers and serial killers in this movie. Watching everyday human evil being defeated by a much more powerful supernatural evil, like a demon is my favorite kind of story. I hope this movie follows along in that vein.",1
The parodies of Disney milking the series and this couldnt be further from the truth,0
Come on! Do we really need to reboot this movie too?,0

"My favourite book of all time. Ive been dying for a proper TV adaptation of it, with proper respects to its Colombian roots and cultures. This seems like its going for that but something about the trailer is off, it doesnt seem that well directed, rather a bit cheesy and trying to be too epic which the b.ook is anything but (it ends up being epic because of the sheer chronological scale, but its told very unpretentiously at the micro level, not the macro).Hope Im wrong, the greatest novel of all time deserves an equally great adaptation.",2

Jesuss Blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins.  Jesus was entombed for three days.  Jesus was seen, heard and touched by witnesses who said Jesus is alive.  Jesus ascended to heave and sat down on the right hand of God.  Jesus will return to the earth.  Jesus is Lord.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God has raised Him from the dead you shall be saved.  Any one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, that any one who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.  Jesus said, No greater love has one that this, that one lay down his life for his friends.Look up 1Corinthians 15:3-8",1

Maybe well see Amanda Ripley???,1
Mustve been comfortable around all that booty.,1
Im intrigued :eyes:,2
"Ill be honest with you... I dont buy Austin Butler as the tough biker gang guy. His face, demeanor, or acting does not match the character he is portraying at all for me, the same with Timothee Chalamet when he played Young Henry V in The King. I never bought Timothee as a leader or a badass either in that role... these two just dont suit these characters at all. Just because they are hot or pretty does not mean they should be cast in every role, man. Tom Hardy, on the other hand, suits the role perfectly, Michael Shannon also. But I will see, I guess... maybe I will proven wrong and Austin delivers a great performance but this trailer did not do it for me.",0
What a creative vampire movie.,2
oh this is going to be soooooo good,2

I like how this brought back the retro-future aesthetic from the first two movies. It looks like a modernized version of what people thought the future would look like in the late 70s/early 80s. There hasnt been an Alien title to replicate that environment since Alien Isolation.,2

And the greatest loss that a person loses in this life is that he lives while he does not know God who created him, knowing the Messenger of Muhammad, the last of the messengers, and the Islamic religion, the last of the heavenly religions.  The great intelligence, before you believe in something or not, is to read it, study it, and understand it well, and then you have the choice to believe in it or not. I advise you on this now before you do not have time to do that.",1

"In the barracks at Ft Leonard wood Missouri we had 3 tornadoes :tornado::tornado::tornado: circle us. Had to flip all the bunks to block the doorways. 32 of us in the hallway on the floor listening to that was just insane. They were only within view and were still very loud and menacing. Loved the first movie, cant wait for this one. The original was the only thing Ive ever seen on film that captured a real experience (as close as you can get on a screen anyway). Im hoping this will be shown in 4K. Should make for a great viewing experience!",2
Original Twister kid here. Definitely going to see this - cant wait to see which product placement they choose to save the day this time!,2
So... does this mean that in this story Scar and Mufasa are not brothers? At least they should have made it 2d,1
What did I just watch lol,0
"Currently re-reading the book. Best novel of all time, change my mind. I thought I was dreaming when I saw this video appear on my page.",2

Why does penguin have an american accent? Hes british :thinking_face:,1
I still bet that most people wouldnt be able to tell that was Colin Farrell if they hadnt heard it was him. I am super excited for the show... but can we please stop the stupid Teaser Starts Now or Trailer Starts Now thing. It is just as bad when the radio plays part of the song before they play the full song. We all know how to work the internet now if we missed something or want to watch it over.,2
Had the pleasure of working on this!!!,2
Disneys Alien is cool! :),2
"I spent just over 3 years in prison, almost 10 years ago. I didnt do theater in there, but I and my fellow inmates were allowed to perform real, live music behind those brick walls and barbed wire. Those are the days when I would feel most free. I still have the notebooks filled with the words I wanted to sing, or scream maybe, through those bars and up and over those walls. Youre supposed to be tough in prison, you know? No crying allowed. Yet I know when I watch this film I will probably cry like a baby, watching these men fight through the idle time and isolation of incarceration and yet somehow finding a way to escape it all; and in doing so remember that theres still a soft and gentle soul alive inside each of us that just wants to play with the person that is suffering, standing right next to us. I damn near cried from the trailer alone. Cant wait to see it. A24 doesnt disappoint.",2
Well i gues neon now how to make a trailers because got damn this looks good same with Long Legs,2
This is my Barbie.,2
This is the concept film I wanted to see as a young fan of the transformers but its just plays into way to young of audience and it seems it will reference the lore but not actually be built with the lore at heart. But its cool they are making a kids film so the newer generations still have transformers in their lives. Also more animated transformers movies please,2
There is only ONE Ellen Replay. Stop making remakes,0
"Ugh. Just read the book, its amazing.",2
James killed it in glass he plays crazy psycho so good,2
They need to learn how to make trailers again they just gave the whole thing away,0
His daughter is the killer he just helps hide it,1
Wow this looks absolutely horrible. What a complete waste of money to make.,0
Is that the honey monster,1
Is it a movie or series?,1
This shouldve been 2d animated,0
Id appreciate it greatly if Disney kept their diverse and inclusive limp dribbling schlong out of the final cut of this movie. Heres to hoping that Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman got what they wanted.,1
"Okay. It looks good. Well, the teaser does anyway.",2
Its a damn shame Colin Farrel is just listed as a NOMINEE he deserves more than oscar,2
One thing about Halle Berry movies is shes going to be fighting for her son!,2
"Well this might be a massive career killer for everyone, I hope it isnt as awful as it looks",0
"The real twist is that dude in the hairpiece the whole time, thats Bruce Willis.",1
I think the boys are dead and she did voodoo to attach them to the house and things are hunting her for them to rest idk… maybe Im overthinking,1

Unbreakable Glass Trap,1
First,1
Its got a lot to live up too.. It might have the effects but It doesnt have Bill...,1
Excited.,2
"ABBA for a Netflix mystery thriller. Man, the cocaine must be good.The effect is somewhat chilling, tho. Maybe not for the good reasons, but lets say they tried something original.Benedict looks classy, as always.",2
"So innecessary. There is no way this remake is going to be better than the original. Also, why do they have to spoil the entire freaking movie on the trailer???",0
Literally NOBODY ASKED 4 THIS MOVIE,0
"I love how the film seems to explore the differences between the joy-ride chaser and the scientific chaser, but instead of a rivalry, they team up. Dont let us down!",2
Dont reveal everything :enraged_face:,0
I got the goddamn heebie jeebies watching that.,2

In honor of Bill Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman dont mess this up,1
"As a trained storm chaser for the National Weather Service in Texas, Im excited to see this come back after 27 years. I have been around since the original in 1996 & have that VHS behind glass in a display case to this day with my other severe storms photo collection nearby it. Universal has impressed me so far, & Im hard to impress when it comes to storm movies being a storm chaser who has directly seen real storms in action. The original movie is very special to a ton of people especially those that grew up with the original. The original is special to me as well. Rest in peace Bill Paxton & Philip Seymour Hoffman Dusty.Bill Paxton would be very proud to have seen his ideas come to life. They are gone, but not forgotten. I will be seeing the sequel for myself. Oh, and I better hear an original soundtrack or its not Twister!",2
"I love Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, but WHY cant we get a mask? Why are we being denied the one thing that would literally BREAK the badass meter? :expressionless_face:",0
"At the start, when she is dancing there is a mirror in the center of the shot and you see Halle but not the boys.",1
I hope there is a better ending because it semms identical and the Danish version was very dark but also very good.,2
Now this is gonna be epic!!!,2
"Great, so I dont need to see the entire movie. Thanks.",0
Oh I want to see this!,2
He translates the gypsys sanskrit book at the last minute as the storm destroys the village with him being the only one in it. The end. Stupid book.,0
Hunter Schafer would make for a great Final Girl,2

Ill give it a chance but ill only pay matinee prices as my hopes are not high at all. But i said the same about Top Gun and the sequel actually was not as bad as i thought it was going to be,2
"Im scared to watch this one, I dont Wana cry",2
Very intrigued. That shadow and shot where she sneaks on her the 2nd time are :OK_hand:,2
"Wow! Now this looks like a throwback! I just love the classic Alien aesthetic, cant wait to see how it looks updated graphically.",2
Go watch sons of anarchy,1
This is Colman Domingos time. Oscar is written all over this.,2
Tom Fucking Hardy :fire::fire:,0
They shouldnt have made a movie of this masterpiece,0
Those Levis Type Is might be the reason i see this movie,2
"just take my money, and gimme tickets. ive waited long enough for this.",2
"If I did not know Netflix, then I would have said this is brave, but I know them.",1
Mufasa Nat Geo Wild edition is wilding,1

"Damn, this looks fantastic.",2
Cgi... showing the monster... this doesnt pass the litmus test,0
Okay.. its time to rewatch Twister.,1
Guy on the speaker sounds like Alastor!:grinning_face_with_sweat:,1
"A24, you have great movies. You really are something beyond everything. This year is your year:raised_fist_dark_skin_tone::black_heart::ringed_planet:",2
The prequel to Kraven the hunter movie,1
:face_with_open_mouth:wow his back his a great actor :clapping_hands:,2
Hunter is insanely good.,2

I wish the end of this universe was tied to scarlet witch,1
I just realized that I´m more a romantic comedy kind of guy...,1
 doctor stranger? :skull::fire:,1
Good luck to these no name actors trying to carry this film like the legends of Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton did for the original. Fun fact Universal Studios had a really cool Twister ride that is now shutdown back in the day but If this is even half as good as the OG movie I will give it a chance.,2
This looks great,2
"M. Night Shyamalan an easy pass for me, no thanks. He has good ideas but the movies end up being garbage with cringe acting moments and horrible plot twist.",0
Did you see the cow?,1
Bike riders is the best they could come up with?,0
Lets go Johnny Langdon!!!,2
Its giving a Black spin on the Naga mythos. If you watch the trailer in slo mo you can clearly see that the snake humanoid is a woman cuz it has boobs. And the shot of the woman in the tub with the snake tat is clearly Halle Berry. Clearly. Lol Shes gonna be the monster and has the kids tethered to the house to keep them safe...FROM HER while shes out eating. Clearly.,1
Josh Hartnett is a Scream King. Halloween H20. The Faculty. 28 Days Later. Penny Dreadful. Im so ready for this to be another addition to the crown.,2
Who is the girl with telekinesis alternate professor X?,1
"Transformers One, or more lesbians.",1
"My theory is that his daughter is the real Butcher, and hes trapped as well, so he has to protect her because its his daughter.",1
now this is what we want !!!,2
Soooo basically they stole the idea from Tethered... How original :face_with_rolling_eyes:,0
"Why is it so hard to get a decent transformers story with decent animation. What next, musical?",0
I see the plot going down as the kids and the audience start off believing there are entities. Then the movie will make us start to believe the mom is just crazy. Then at the end it turns out shes not crazy.,1
Damn I had to take a deep breath after it was over,2
That ghoulish looking woman is a fantastic scary design,2
The downfall of transformers begins:frowning_face:,0
what is the name of the music ,1
"am I the only one terrified of this film? Like I really love both characters and the actors that made those characters theirs, like they are the only ones I can see in the roles, Robert downey is Iron Man, Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool and Hugh Jackman is THE Wolverine.But is all of that the makes me scared of what possible trappings could be in the movie. I would not like to have the memories of both portrayals to be destroyed by Disney",0
Stupid trailer full of spoilers,0
He plays the heck outta psycho :grinning_face_with_sweat:,2
Looks Interesting. Please be good. :persevering_face:,2
Megatron is the responsible one...in this one.. :grinning_squinting_face:,1
Sigh,0
Cant wait to watch it.. one of the literary pieces we studied in college,2
Its interesting because you dont know if there are actually malevolent creatures in the woods or if the mother (Halle) is suffering from extreme psychosis and is keeping her boys tethered to the house for no reason.,1
Mickey and family,1
The main question is; will it be a movie or a limited series? I cant see just being done to the book in a movie format know they stretch it out to 3 hours at least,1
Ill watch anything with Hunter Schafer in it :relieved_face::red_heart: i cant wait it. I love her so much :red_heart::red_heart: I remember Dan Stevens in The Guest. He really nailed unsettling characters.,2
I wonder if Batman shows up,1
It was far longer than 7 years since we had a good aliens movie,1
Disney turn off the comments on their posted trailer :face_with_tears_of_joy:,0
"Okay, I was not expecting anything from the Alien universe at all. This is friggin awesome! This has throwback hints of 1 & 2....if these scenes are truly just snippets, this movie could be fantastic. I cannot wait!",2
"Should hidden the fact that he is the butcher, 80% of the movies is in the trailer, all that left is M Night :clown_face: twisted ending.   Middle finger to whicher studio exectives approved this trailer.:middle_finger:",0
Monsters wears many faces.,1
Ughhh yessss iam happy for horror right now :clapping_hands::clapping_hands:,2
Love the colour grading in this!!,2
"The way Tom Hardy says, burn it down so casually.  I really hope this is good.",2
Im obsessed with Dan Stevens weirdo characters and their accents,2
Hes the bad guy in the movie,1
if james eral jones isnt in it im very disapointed,1
"Ill watch it, but Im not going to be happy we never got to see the prequel finish its trilogy.",0
Jodie Comers midwestern accent is the equivalent to Dick Van Dykes Cockney accent.,0
Song name at  ?,1
And thank you loads for not giving away the plot of this movie!,2
EVERYTHING that A24 drops gets watched,2
"Oh I know this movie, its a remake of a danish film. Excited to see this version!",2
Yay CGI! Isnt that why the only good movies were the first two?,2
A lion was born without a drop of nobility in his blood... Isnt that a retcon of the original??? Just changing the story and giving us something no one asked for. Way to go Disney,0
Why is he reading Sanskrit?,1
Oooffah,1
holy heck this looks amazing!,2
I hope the movie looks better than this trailer! It looks like cheap computer graphics. It doesnt have that same same look like the first movie.,0
Bro Ive been literally waiting,2
Ahh Ive been excited but this trailer feels all over the place. Fingers crossed!,2
I can already tell you how this movie is going to end. Either escapes and has the black guy as his next victim. Or he just simply escapes.,1
"Love the 80s/90s look, makes you feel even more like youre going to get something meaningful.",2
Im so excited :party_popper::party_popper:,2
Austin Butler is a great actor :clapping_hands:,2
"Lose the toupee and jacket, button up the shirt and he looks exactly like Walter White",1
More cows in the tornado. Moo.,1
Who actually wants to watch this crap? Looks like youd be better off watching the ok original again :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:,0
"Saw the thumbnail and was immediately like, A24 prison movie? Lets go, sold. Then I watched like thirty seconds of the trailer and was like A24 prison movie about a prison theater program? I NEED TO SEE THIS IMMEDIATELY",2
"I mean, Austin butlers talent is glowing in everything he does. And Tom Hardy? Im sold.",2
Just why?,0
"There is no way this will work. How can someone reimagine Marquezs work into tv?. Who can rewrite this to tv or any other media for that matter ?.. How can this masterpeice get fit into a generic 8 episode per season format of Netflix?.  Netflix could not even do  justice to  Avatar the last air bender and that was a freaking cartoon !!!!. Netflix will never understand what this book really means. If they understood that, they will not even attempt to make this in to a tv show. It is not just a  novel. It is the history of a continent.. No one can rewrite this to tv. If you say Marquez has reborn and wrote the script, then I will beleive there is a chance for it to work.  Otherwise, this will not work !. (No, I am not hoping for  it not to work. I want it to work. That would be amazing. But I know it willl not !)",0
So the only real transformer movie is an animation alright hollywood the gig is up we tired of yall taking our :money_bag:,0
"Gabriel didnt want any of his novels to be made into TV shows because he wanted everyone to have a version of his books in their headsThis book is my favourite of all time, Ill watch the show but cant help feeling sad about that",0
We need this bloody bang from Marvel :party_popper:,0
Transformers with Human Interaction stills the best. :red_heart:,2
I believe I speak for everyone when I say: yawn,2
I feel like this is what Goldbug would be like if he gotten his time to shine after all these years. It couldnt hurt if he somehow made a comeback.,2
"The original Danish version of this movie litterally traumatized me. Hands down, one of the most sinister, chilling and unforgiving thrillers that Ive ever seen. I knew nothing about the movie when I watched it, and did not see it coming at all. This trailer is already giving away too much. My recommendation would be to first watch the Danish version if you can. It will haunt you.",0
The Penguin looks like becoming one of the best TV-shows of 2024. The Batman is great so this one must be great as well. We need 2 years before The Batman Part 2 comes out. So its a perfect project to release between them.,2
Exactly as I imagined AMAZINGG,2
"There are three killers in the stadium, The Butcher, The Baker and The Candlestick Maker! Which  one is he?!?",1
Its weird that this trailer is now downplaying any connection to the photojournalist Danny Lyon and his book The Bikeriders… when they were clearly making at least a small connection between the two with the trailer that released last year… now it feels like they are trying to sell it as an original story.. the Vandals… we know which club their supposed to be hahaha :grinning_face_with_sweat:,0
Never been this excited for an mcu film since No Way Home,2
So good.  So glad they kept the look and feel of the Twister.  Cant wait to see it.,2
OMG this looks so unique and special. Anything Benedict is in is pure gold. I cant wait!!! :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,2
Im getting Thor Ragnarok feelings for this and not a big fan.  Need a more pg-13 style movie not a g rated movie,0
Austin Butler is a movie star.,2
Oh man... This film is gonna make me cry :face_with_tears_of_joy:,2
Dont think this will translate well into a series.Movies are just too literal. Just one of best books ever,0

wish  I knew why they have to gay EVERY single movie out now.. LMfAO.. evvvvverything out today .. what a disgusting shame,0
"I didnt think anyone could hold a candle to Bill Paxton and the original, but this looks epic. Glenn Powell was excellent in Top Gun: Maverick. I will definitely be seeing this on the biggest screen possible",2
They remade a perfect movie…. Like whyyyyyyyyyyy!,0
"This movie is gonna crush us, isnt it",2
The animals look more like cartoon characters. Theyre making facial expressions this time around.,1
I bet hes not the killer...,1
Anybody wanna talk about antmans giant carcass?,1
It looks fun. Im gonna watch it and treat it as an actual prequel,2
"Why is this a remake??? Why not a sequel?!? Yeah, this looks good, but still, its not a good choice :smiling_face_with_open_hands:",0
"Im getting notes for A Quiet Place, Birdbox, and It Comes at Night.",1
Hes really the beast that escaped and tried to live a normal life.,1
What theeee heellllllllllllll,0
The MCU going to be back on top again and I never doubted them,2
"A24 is the Nintendo of the movie industry. Everyone else blundering around with pretty graphics, big set pieces, a-list voice actors, and movies that feel like every other movie. A24 just shakes their head and puts out thought provoking horror movies, feel good prison dramas, a movie about lighthouse workers losing their minds, a girl who wears a garden on her head and kills people that you actually somehow still feel sorry for, whatever tf green knight was all about...Fat pocket execs trying to study and research what makes a movie money. A24 making everyone remember what makes a good movie.",2
" I personally thought she looked like a cool manga character with the background too, damn she is already amazing!",2
"yess this looks amazing!! Ive seen M. Night Shymalans Old and Knock at the Cabin and if Trap is anything like those movies, I cant wait!",2
The best book I ever read,2
"Ryan Reynolds, just saved the MCU. Its a good day.",2
This looks ridiculously bad. A horrible 80s horror flick,0
GOOD cast ! :D,2
Reminds me of my neighbor and her son,1
"Good thing they brought in Hugh Jackman as wolverine to save this movie, because deadpool2 was maybe a 5 out of 10",2
Colman Domingo and Paul Racing is such powerhouse duo. Cant wait to see this film.,2
Its already out tho,1
Very Nice :slightly_smiling_face:,2
Minecrafted Transformers,1
So excited for this she was amazing in Gothika,2
"The woke destruction of another iconic movie...They wont rest til they destroy it all folks, when you cant formulate unique quality ideas, you rewrite history and form it to your own agenda.Im gonna go ahead and predict this will bomb just like the rest of the woke garbage they try and force feed us.Sad part is they get funded with our tax dollars even when we dont pay to watch this trash.",0
This looks like the kinda movie for Fonda and Nicholson,1
Why is antman here?,1
Man Tom Hardy is the GOAT!!!,2
The ending was amazing! Best scene in years!,2
The trap is this commercial. He just gave away the entire movie. Why?,0
Really hope its good not like covenant,2

All I want is to watch the same thing again and again but worse every time. Thank god for Hollywood.,0
So they remade Speak no evil but in english. The original still looks creepier,1
Josh hartnett still acts?This just an excuse to get his daughter in a movie?,0
MAN THIS IS THE BEST YEAR FOR HORROR SO FAR :red_heart:,2

@ Is...that a Mad Max Fury Road type of reference or universe?!:anguished_face:,1
Literally who asked for a Twister remake?,1
"I cant believe Harley is sponsoring/endorsing a movie about 1%ers! Your 2024 bike intro has bikers blatantly breaking the law all through the ad, and now you are behind this movie about blatant law-breaking!How about making a movie about law-abiding bikers- like 99% of the biker community?",0
"I dont have any high hope about this. Just anything better than Into The Storm and Im good. The OG Twister is such a classic, you need to be extremely good to be on par, let alone beat it.",2
They should of left this movie alone.,0
Coleman Domingo is going to kill this! it looks so honest and authentic. I cant wait to watch it.,2
It would be neat if he obtained his iconic top hat and monocle in this series!,2
Glad to see the previous terrible script ideas were disposed of :wastebasket:,2

"The gun says Smile. Wait for the flashAlso, is that a 20th century fox logo? :face_with_open_mouth:Is that Ant Mans super sized skeleton?Alioth from Loki.",1
Looking forward to it. Jeff Nicols is a really good director and Austin Butler......what can I say.......Id see anything he is in as well as Tom Hardy. Going to see Dune 2 tomorrow where I hear Austin Butler is brilliant.,2
No I hopw if only you guys have followed and make its quality like tranformer to transformer last knight. like real not a cartoon type,1
Were getting so much of Austin this year and I love it,2
Looks like Isolation in the best way possible,2

Omg is this a remake of the old twister movie??,1
Is that the Map guy from original Twister?:face_with_open_mouth: Looks alike:thinking_face:,1
Mufasa seems strangley attatched to the Great Kings of the Past for being one born without a drop of nobility.,1
Its such irony how a lot of the movie is about cleaning up the trash and the homeless living underground when in reality the trash that needed cleaning was the elite of New York City. Such a good show. 10 out of 10,2

Even if there are more twists... can you please not reveal this in the trailer??? I mean.. seriously?!?! do you even pay professionals any more?,0

I was very happy to see Halle Bellini in the cinema again.,2
Omggg this is really happening!!!!:party_popper::party_popper:,2
"*Spoiler Warning* This show had me captivated until I realize that the kid was hiding out this entire time, while he had the whole city praying for his safe return, as he continue to drain valuable police resources just to get back at his dad because he got yelled. I dont think the main characters are suppose to be this unlikeable, they unintentionally perpetuate the stereotype that white kids and middle age gentrified artist are actually entitled spoiled little pricks with first world problems pretending to be the solution to real issues. Meanwhile they live in their bubble of naiveté.",0

I tried reading this book ions ago.  Never finished it.  I dont remember that there was any action :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,0
Ohhh yes please,2
Very intriguing especially because of Benedict and the whole kid monster plot idea.,2
This looks like Birdbox or A Quiet Place. I am interested in seeing this.,2
Please dont put any woke character in this,0
Yo Is it just me or does  sounds like when Jetfire first transformed in ROTF,1

"first impressions:-immediately has people HIDING UNDER A GOD DAMN UNDERPASS which is extremely unsafe and if they dont make an example of how dangerous that is im gonna be furious-anthony ramos??????-making the bill replacement more yeehaw is a choice. hopefully it wont be his whole character. original movie made things feel like oklahoma with the vibes, not just making it in your face-cgi looks way better than any other tornado movie ive seen since the original which is sick. the wide shots were gorgeous-still unrealistic in how tornadoes cause damage so hopefully the charm will overrule the innacuracy like the original. please focus on the chasers and the love for severe weather pleasee-WHY IS DOROTHY BACK WE ALREADY HAD DOROTHY 30 YEARS AGO. SURELY WE COULDVE INCORPORATED SOMETHING NEW THATS NOT DOROTHY LIKE HOW WERE CURRENTLY USING SUPERCOMPUTERS TO GENERATE TORNADIC EVENTS AND SEE THE DATA INSIDE TORNADOES THAT WAY )GO DR. LEIGH ORF!!!)-no hints at a banger soundtrack. immediately disappointed-it was all kind of just the classic disaster movie p0rn that trailers have so i really dont know what itll be like story wise all i know is im irritated and concerned and just want this to be half as good as the original-rip billy and philip they better get a tribute",0
Been waiting for this a long time,2

The other movie came out only two years ago.,1
"Looks solid for sure. I wish I remembered the name of the rental movie this reminds me of. Its a young man alone, same setting and hes blind. His parents taught him how to live and survive before they died  cause of a thing in the woods. Then a black gentleman appears and stays for awhile and befriends him.

"The visuals look promising, but Im not quite sold yet. The original Alien was a slow burn, character-driven narrative with a wider overarching narrative about corporate greed. Alien (and even Alien 3) were not just some slasher flick full of cheap jump scares. I hope this film honors that.",1
"You and I broke the laws of God & Jesus paid the price. With the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. Romans 10:10",1

I m just praying that they made the script good. Not too speedy bud creating a chemistry! I cant bear this movie failing after hughs u-turn.,0

Its redundant to make a movie or show for every freaking character IMO.,0
lowkey I was hoping that this movie be a healing/drama genre,1

"Thats the dude from the new hunger games , honestly maybe one of the worst actors Ive ever seen .Cant believe these people keep getting movie roles . Its almost these studios dont want to turn a profit .",0
Now that looks good.,2
So pretty much the Sopranos but in Gotham... I dig it :fire:,2
"Its official, Hollywood is out of original ideas. Now theyre just gonna make reboots/remake old movies while fucking them up, changing gender and race of the main characters. And god forbid some snowflakes takes offense of anything in the remake.",0

This looks fantastic,2
I love that these post-apocalyptic thrillers are coming out! This is my type of genre. Adding this to my calendar :spiral_calendar:,2
It needs to have more Jodie Comer. Hope the delayed release will be targeting the Oscars.,1

This is awesome! Do you agree?,2
Damn. I feel like this trailer showed too much.,0
"Im hoping this is connected to unbreakable, split, glass. By the way they are calling him the butcher it def sounds like a villian name people usually say serial killer. If not either ways it looks good nonetheless :OK_hand:",2

Thank you to the trailer maker who respected the audiences attention spans by not putting THE MOST EXTREME ACTION five seconds before the trailer even started.,2
My favorite novel of all time.  If they mess this up I will not forgive them.,2
Looks good but theres alot of women in the cast and only 2 men.Knowing recent times its likely alot more effort went into the representation and woke trash that is now a standard for latest films.Dont be surprised if some African American lady ends up saving the day and defeating the evil white man and saving the daughter and riding off into the sunset together...,2
Love it.,2
please invent some kind of mask that can protect your mouth from alien thing....,1
I really cant believe its Colin Farrell; I find it hard to comprehend how he could act in such a different way.,2

"It absolutely disgusts me that this movie exists and now I feel more than validated with the release of this trailer.The plot sounds exactly the same as the first movie, updated to include 21st century meteorological terminology and weather chasing equipment. The CGI tornadoes look LIKE COMPLETE SHIT compared to the original films. NONE OF THE CAST ARE RETURNING. And the worst thing is, Ill probably STILL see it in theaters because goddamn it: its the sequel to my absolute favorite movie on the planet, and I love natural disaster films.RIP BILL PAXTON. RIP PHILIP S. HOFFMAN.",0
this is one trippy bushcraft survival movie.,2
"This is going to be good. Cumberbatch, Mystery, weirdness and great cinematography. The shots work and many make me curious for more.",2
I simply think is foolish to try to adapt this novel into a movie or series Heck! I even think that it is only truly enjoyable to read it in Spanish So much gets lost when translating it into another language or medium,0
I bet this woke and inclusive and diverse Holywood will cast a man this time as main character after decades of Riplay and Dr Elizabeth Shaw playing main role.. Oh wait.. forgot it works only one way round..,1
This movie is proof that Austin Butler NEEDS to play Johnny Blaze.,1
i hope gunn will not touch this universe after what he did with other one.,2

"This cast is stacked, cant wait for this movie to finally be released!",2
idk why but after seeing Benedict Cumberbatch doing an American accent I was like I gotta watch it,2
Looking forward to it,2
Im a little skeptical. The original Twister is a classic. I do see they put Dorothy sensors in this. IDK. Well see.,1
I bet theyre a taken a page out of the sopranos??? That would be awesome!,2
One of the most interesting books Ive ever read. Be interesting to see how it translates to cinema,2

Seeing this bitch in theaters baby,2
"I was 10 going on 11 when the first one came out in theaters back in 96 and I doubt that this is going to fill me with the same sense of awe and wonder that that film did. I even went on the Twister ride at Universal Studios in Orlando and had one of those swirly water tornado in a glass paperweights, thats how much the first one got me so invested in tornadoes at such a young age!",1
"fu ck me, have to go to the theater for this one, bad or good, dont even care.",2
Perhaps its time to re-read One Hundred Years of Solitude. What an imagination! Edit: :butterfly:,2

"Hes come so far in his career as an actor. Looking forward for his performance in this and future projects! Cant believe hes the same guy who played Mr Tumnus, Prof X and The Beast in Split!",2
what a true American hero Austin Butler is. He was able to get over his debilitating Elvis impersonation speech impediment,2
If Lee Pace would have played James role we could have gotten a Halt and Catch Fire Reunion,1
"So glad Colman is getting his shots in as a leading actor in projects now. He is such a force!  I cant wait to be in the theaters smiling, sobbing, cheering, etc to this",2

Why would you reveal the main plot twist of the film in the trailer,0
Awesome Trailer Cant wait to see the movie,2
I love the part where he transforms into a truck without even stepping on earth to see what one looks like. Awesome writing.,0
This film is not yet rated. The suspense is killing me.,0
Its sad when one opens up to emotions and people think you are faking it.,1
Finally Netflix is making something that celebrates us instead of constant crime documentaries.,2
"I love how everyones all saying, I hope it lives up to the original, or, It better live up to the original. Lemme tell you all this right now; its NOT going to live up to the original. AT ALL. Twister had a great cast of A-Listers playing memorable characters, with top-notch specials effects and a stellar soundtrack. THIS movie has a cast of nobodies, probably all playing forgettable characters. It has the size and scale to be an impressive spectacle movie, but thats probably about it. Im not saying that it wont be decent, Im just saying DONT set your expectations too high. This ISNT Twister 96. Curb those expectations and you might have a decent time.",1
See you in July,2

"Twist, Josh Hartnett and his daughter are ghosts who were killed by the butcher and the black guy is the adult version of Haley Joels character in the  the 6th sense but recast as black for wokeness.",1
Bayverse and g1 fans are such crybabies the trailer just came out :skull:,1
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS SERIES!!!!!,2

Its just zombies. Why cant they come in the house?:thinking_face:,0
"I hope its good, but… trailer didnt scare me",2
Man they couldve at least put some effort into this movie. Id rather just watch a Reed Timmer livestream,0
Im surprised they made a remake...The original was half in english and amazing,2
you had me at the makers of chernobyl,2
Why did she take this role?!  Too scary!,0
Damn this looks good,2
Kinda has vibes of that Colin Farrell film Phone Booth with a villainous twist to it. Looks interesting.,2
This looks like its gonna be great!,2
Im in.,2
this is like an 80s color look but this one puts me so emotional.,2
The original was crazy,2
"Guys we gonna see dead giant antman skull,  sling ring portal we dont know who opened portal as per our experience we know wong appear as cameo everywhere, but rumours out there that Dr.strange going to appear in the movie along with clea - by introducing us about incursions",1

Is this an animated movie or is the cgi just that bad?,0
im sorry but all i can see is tia dalma/calypso speaking :face_with_tears_of_joy:,1
Where is all the diversity and LGBTQ that Netflix always injects into western culture? Why does Netflix only do that to western shows? Great novel and source material but you can see the hypocrisy of these studios.,0
"Wow, these are so many twisters.",1
I really hope they dont put COLONIALISM SUCKS and everyone should be LGBTQ shit in there and ruin it. But this is expecting too much Netflix I know.,0
This looks so good,2
"So whats the pitch for this one? The first one followed a bunch of storm chasers as they tried to help develop a better tornado warning system to help save lives. This one just looks like it follows storm chasers in it just for the thrill and danger. I mean, Im still gonna watch it, but wanna know what the story is.",1
why this movie has only white casts?,0
"Nice, Encanto live action :grinning_face_with_sweat:!",2

Soft drinks of choice for Farrell.,1

Saw it tonight at the Miami Film Festival. This is a marvelous and beautiful movie. It will be in theaters 7/12/24. Dont miss it!,2
So.....somebody already have hippies long hair before the hippies born,1
"Its so hard to believe this guy is actually Colin Farrell. Not only makeup is amazing, also Colin Farrell is incredibly good in the role. I loved all his scenes in The Batman, he completely stole every scene hes in. That mıovie should have won oscar for best supporting actor and best makeup.",2
"Looks so good, great roles for Hardy and Butler",2
Ice lions ? In Africa ? :face_with_tears_of_joy:,1
They could have made this in 2d animation like the OG Lion King,1
"The movie concept is  very dark!!! .imagine this was a real story,the sufferings of child.:pensive_face::pensive_face:",1
Marvel really made a comeback.,2
Cool. This will be the only THE BATMAN content well have until The Batman Part 2 in a few years. Enjoy kids.,2
Dan Stevens...? Yes and thank you!,2
"James Mc range is wider than the Grand Canyon, also didnt realise how much he looks like Gerard Butler until now .",2
Crazy to have Collin Farrell star and not even have him in the trailer,1
Jax would be disappointed…,0
You realize it will be a success when there is no FARRELL at all on what you see + THE SOPRANOS vibe.,2
Bill Paxton wouldve been amazing for this had he lived longer,1
First marvel movie Ive been excited for since No Way Home,2
Now making all movies retro :grinning_face_with_sweat:,1
"Fiiiiiinally!! No humans in the Transformers!! No GF drama and no stupid Puerto Rican power ranger lameness(and yes i am Boricua, and that $#!T sucked)",0

Abba doesnt let its music be used in shite. This will be good,2
Ive been waiting for another tornado/twister movie.,1
"Wow, Im triggered actually.  I had to stop at .  As an EoDM fan, this is a bit too much for me I think, which is a bummer because Ive never missed an M.Night film. But hard pass for me. Concerts have been my life-line and safe-space for 40 years; I cant even fathom the premise and hope the twist course corrects it. Even finishing watching the trailer is a hard pass for me, sorry Mr. Shyamalan :folded_hands:, still appreciate your work, but this induced a panic attack.",0
there was a similar movie not too long ago,1
Dont Be An Outsider While Beating It To Old Marlon Brando Photos While Smoking Your Cigs In The Burbs,1
"As an alien fan since like 6 years old, this trailer visibly made me excited.  Please please be good.",2
"My theory the father and the daughter are both in on the killings, the daughter is the Butcher, and shes simply at the concert to enjoy it but he is her security whos looks out for her and he wants to make sure she gets to enjoy the show.",1
"told everyone Austin Butler can be close to Johnny Depp, glad to see he takes up on a biker role",2
The best part is when they give it away in the trailer that hes the butcher. I guess that is not the Shymalan twist in this movie.,2
Same character from split and glass ?? Um great,2
Yms is gonna tear this garbage to shreds,0
The last film made a billion at the box office. Sadly its gonna over shadow sonic 3.,0
that is the reason Western people dont make friends anymore,0
Ughh they are ruining my transformers,0
Actually looks pretty good.. but whats with that name... Sounds AI generated.. lol,2
James McAvoy looks like an AI mashup of Russell Crowe and Ricky Gervais.,1
looks bad and cheap,0
This is a proper horror trailer.,2
Ugh . Disney again ?? :face_vomiting:,0
"Can we go back to classic 2D animations for these? You know, when it felt like Disney had a soul?",0
Its brave of the creators to even attempt to make this! :red_heart:,2
Saw an advanced screening of this in November… its decent but missed the mark for me,0
"Great, maybe they classic  movie of 2024",2
"Finally, the X-Men weve been waiting for..",2
Honestly the way B turn and start running had me  dying :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:,2
100% written just to launch his daughters music career. I expect no real effort put into the story.And the twist is that Hartnetts daughter is actually the killer.,0
The original was one of the creepiest movies that Ive ever seen. I wonder if they can make it better in this remake.,1
I saw it at the Telluride festival. highly recommend. Tom Hardy is gorgeous as always.:thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up::hundred_points::fire:,2
Why would they remake this movie? It was already great and this looks exactly the same/worse because its a remake,0
"Huh, a suspense thriller through the perspective of the killer, rather than some random person with a wrong place wrong time scenario. Not gonna lie, Im intrigued.",2
"Sigh, Im ready for Halle to be in a movie where shes relaxed and having fun.  Her latest movies have been about trauma.",0
"whats even  the point if of this trailer? every major plot, twist, reaction has been revealed. first 30 seconds, I wanted to watch it in s theatre, by the end of the trailer, 90% of the story has been revealed. Now why would I watch the movie? I can just read the ending online and be done with it.",0
Finally finally some Benedict Cumberbatch content :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart: And how lovely to listen to ABBA in 2024! :musical_notes:,2
You did your thing beloved :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: I cant wait to see this!,2
Definitely going to the movies for this:raising_hands_medium-light_skin_tone::raising_hands_medium-light_skin_tone:,2
"man, the laugh at the end",2
Bringing a classic back :fire::fire::fire:,2
Why exactly does it remind people of A Quiet Place and Birdbox?! Is it because it focuses on a family isolated in the woods in a post-apocalyptic world? Because thats been done long before in a lot of movies prior to A Quiet Place and Birdbox. Not like those movies invented a new genre. In A Quiet Place you dont talk and in Birdbox you dont look. Seems to me they are allowed to talk and look in this :flexed_biceps:Am I missing something?,1
Not even a million dollars would make me watch this.... :crying_face::crying_face::crying_face:,0
It would of been a cool concept if she was crazy thinking it was the end of the world but it turns out its not.,1
What is the status of the Halle Berry SOFIA John Wick spinoff?? :thinking_face:,1

"Intrigued to see the novel on the scene written in Sanskrit, a language in which Melquiades spoke.Hats off!",2
"I watch Twister at least once a month, cant wait to sink my teeth into to this. RIP Billy Paxton.",2

Fake or not theyre still milkers :hot_face:,0
"Collin Farell is back and ready to take over the criminal empire in Gotham. Paying off when he asked Batman if he knew his reputation with Batman saying, Yeah. Do you? Now he will",1

Disney: You thought we lost enough last year? Hold our copyright protected drink of whimsy because you aint seen losing money yet!,0
How is this different from bird box and quiet place?,0
I feel like I just watched an entire movie. People are awful at making trailers these days. 3 minutes for a trailer ??,0
The title suggests a sequel but the trailer makes it seem more like a remake.,1
Makes me think of Big Bird and Muppets. Theres something fascinating about them helping guide people because they manifest from the mind. And in this case not being evil.,2
All I know is that Hunter Schaefer wouldve been a really cute boy!,2
New impulse rifle looks like a Helghast rifle from the game Killzone:),2
Trailer reveals too much,0
Its one of my most favourite novels ever :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::raising_hands: so excited to stumble upon this,2
That trailer had a twist so big it had to be a Shyamalan movie.,1
Is this the grounbreaking trans movie. Non binary or whatever ?,1
"Havent read the novel, but this looks very promising.",2
From Bullseye (Daredevil 2003) to The Penguin! Collin Farrell is having a massive glow up with this one.,2

The Summer Blockbusters are back - this looks like a fun thrill ride.,2
"This thrilling true story of resilience and humanity focuses on the life of Divine G, who was imprisoned in Sing Sing for a crime she did not commit and found her purpose in life by performing in a theater group with the men imprisoned there.",2
So they told us who the killer is ..  ok :face_with_tears_of_joy:,1

Plot twist: this is all just a promo for his daughters new album,0
"Ive been working on a two-part animated screenplay for one hundred years of solitude because its just my favorite book ever. Im definitely still eager to see this adaptation, the casting feels strange but the imagery is nice. Theres a lot of things in the book that Id be surprised if they included, just because of what Netflix/audiences are used to, its pretty provocative. but I think the more loyal to the text the better- audiences should be challenged.",2
Isnt this a remake?,1
Nope nope nope nope!!! James is my fav actor and I cant watch this. He is too good at acting. This will make me scared of him for life!,2
Who asked for this?,0
"So the twist goes like this:Daughter is the ButcherDad learned of it, and is trying to keep everything secretOr he is one of the victims That Escaped and hes also looking for the Butcher.",1
We are so back,2

This looks good! Glad to see the creature features are making a comeback. :flexed_biceps_dark_skin_tone::smiling_face_with_sunglasses:,2
"Hilarious! Some people are just terrible at acting but for some reason they constantly get cast in big movies. Examples are bill paxton r.i.p., and that obnoxious guy from top gun 2! Also, phillip seymours worst acting ever, again r.i.p.  that ThE 1st movie was cool looking but the acting was hilarious! It was just dorky with the van halen music and the cutscenes.",0
why make a remake of a 2 year old film? lol cash grab,0
Why cant they make good movies anymore,0
His movies usually starts off interesting but then becomes so predictable.,0
Omg Im looking forward to this. Hunter is underrated :red_heart:,2
"They are all already dead and in the afterlife. The evil spirits are actually good spirits trying to guide the kids to heaven. The mother belongs in hell because she killed them. Oh, spoiler alert.",1
You better release this in Finland on the same date or I will stop my subscription and never come back! We have one of the worst selection of movies and shows in Netflix compared to other countries!,1
"That was a bloody good trailer, man. So rare for horror nowadays.",2
"Theory on Plot TwistThe dad captured the butcher without realizing it was the butcher. It was some creepy guy that did something nasty and the dad decided to chain him up and keep him captive. The butcher had tickets to the concert, so thats how the dad got the tickets. The dad in the film is also a bit psycho for what he is doing. This sometimes tends to happen to people, they get a taste and thirst for blood...then really go psychotic.En route to the concert the dad hears a news report on what the butcher looks like and thinks wow he fits the description pretty close to that creep I got chained up in the basement....but nah.....it isnt him. I mean cmon.....me an average Joe Schmo dad whos maybe even slightly psychotic wouldnt have THE BUTCHER in his basement.But once learning about the police trap....the dad now realizes....oh my God.....I do really have the butcher......And now decides to see how far he can go torturing him. Especially now because he got in through the tickets belonging to THE BUTCHER.Update:I hope it isnt something like in THE VISIT. Where the Butcher is really dead on doppelgänger of the dad, with him killing the dad and then him posing as the dad.",1
I will be seated.,1
The Wild One 2.,1
That trailer spoiled the whole movie… no need to see it anymore now. Thx for that…,0

Eric wouldve been my favorite puppet as a kid.,2
Im a cry this whole movie I can already tell,2
with that voice.... completely transformed,2
Looks great. Cant say I care for all the Fs but I get it I guess. This is about to be the highest grossing movie of all time. The R rated might get in the way of that but this is sooo anticipated that people may give it a pass. Cause Wolverine is the X-men of all time,2
why does Tom Hardys voice change in every movie hes in,1
Pass. Sonic 3.,0
Would be hella awesome when Sigourney Weaver would come as Ellen Ripley to save the day.Hope really they do not try to make it like the last movies.,2
we does he already sound and look suspicious at ,1
This started out good. Then they just started inserting things until the first missing boy is the least important part of the story.,0

Good to see the last few movies halle berry has done have been grittier more acting roles rather than just sex or showing her looks,2
Another trailer that gives away the whole plot and twists of the film. Already familiar with the story from the original film but come on.,0
wheres the backrooms movie Im so waiting:smiling_face_with_tear:,2
"Sighs, whoever his agent is, they pick the best rolls for this man.. I guess no matte what role he knocks it out the park every time for me..",2
"John Laurens storm chasing. Yeah, that tracks.",1
"went into The Batman almost completely blind. All I knew was that Robert Pattinson from Twilight was playing Batman. I didnt know who else was in the cast & I think I only watched the trailer once. As a lifelong Batman fan, I was blown away. Even after sitting theough the entire almost 3 hour movie, (which didnt feel like 3 hours cause I was so immersed in the world that Matt Reeves had created) I had no clue that Colin Farrell was the guy playing the Penguin until the end credits rolled. I say all that to give you a sense of just how brilliant his performance was. My man deserved to win some sort of award. Cant wait for this series to drop this year followed by The Batman sequel in 2026. Well done to Matt Reeves & his entire team.",2
Two of my favourite things Hunter Schafer and horror movies:loudly_crying_face::red_heart::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes::face_with_tears_of_joy::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face:,2

Im here for the music,1
Looks like Alien Isolation which is good.,2
"Is this the new directors much talked about New Vision? Its just more of the same with younger actors. And Ridley Scott, who himself already ruined the franchise he started, has now left it to another director to finish destroying it.",0

Yet another Netflix show pushing an inter racial gay agenda. Does the CEO of Netflix refuse to greenlight a project unless it ticks all the deviant boxes?,0
The the-cinematic universe is here,2
Im thinking a similar outcome like the Village,1
This is the darker and more gritty side of DC we all want. They should stick to this style with their live action.,2
Benedict Cumberbatch should leave Marvel and keep doing serious movies like this one and get an Oscar he absolutely deserves for his talent!,2

"Screening the Documentary Human HarvestA screening of the documentary Human Harvest was held on the afternoon of the last day of the exhibition. It left the audience feeling heavy-hearted.Some said that they knew that the CCP regime was a dictatorship, but they never realized that it was so evil. Harvesting organs from living people and selling them for profit is not human behavior, someone remarked.Some viewers said that they already thought that the CCP was bad, but now they had a deeper understanding of just how bad. I hope those Japanese politicians who are pro-China can clearly see just how evil the CCP is, one said.When viewers raised questions, such as, Why does the CCP suppress Falun Gong? and Why do Falun Gong practitioners refuse to give up their faith despite such a severe suppression? the practitioners were able to provide in-depth, thoughtful answers.Some people said that they wanted to learn the Falun Gong exercises.",1

"Oh, it looks inspirational and heartfelt; no question. But to open a trailer by abridging and misrepresenting Hamlets most famous soliloquy is a little much...",1
Just what everyone didnt ask for... a comedy Transformers kids cartoon. Happy 2024 everyone,2
"Regardless of how the film actually turns out, the trailer was great. Its what a trailer should be, instead of the usual where we get the entire story, look at this famous person whos in our film and quips galore",2
"Why this movie remind me to Arcadian:face_with_tears_of_joy: but with woman as a main char, but i think this more scary. Need to watch it :disguised_face:",2

A24 is amazing. Thank you for everything :white_heart:,2
It wouldve been even better if it was some big bird humanoid figure with feathers sticking out of it. N its like some type of creature they worship and have to bring a new body for it to take over for good farm crop ect..,2
Its a shame that an actual female lost a lead role to a transvestite. Otherwise the trailer looks fine. Not sure I will watch due to casting choice. I stand for real womens rights.,0

Cannot wait for more soulless garbage. This time with nepo-baby voice acting; how fun!,0
And what about the kings ancestors in the sky Watching over them? Disney… please …,1
"I hope what Im seeing in the trailer isnt the actual plot of the story. M Night Shyamalan always gives good twists so Im kinda holding on to the plot where hes gonna be the one whos gonna help the kids & the cops get the killer like he already knew who is the killer due to one of his ckose relatives was killed the same way this killer killed other people so he kept in on the kow & kept his tabs open but somehow got confused by the police & set a trap for him eventhough all he wanted was to avenge someone & slowly becoming the killer he was supposed to catch.

"another waste of time with an inconclusive ending, yawn",0
"Why is it every movie with a tornado after the original twister looks so overly CGI that it ruins the film?  The original did a great job with practical effects.  If this film relies on CGI, its gonna suck.",0
This feels like Birdman of Alcaraz meets Dead Poet Society with a bit of WhiplashI think this could be Domingos chance at winning Best Actor,2
"For those who are planning to watch this series, I would suggest to read the nove first. Other wise you are ruining one of the best aesthetic experience you can have.

COOL!!!But like, I get why they needed transforming to disguise themselves on Earth, but what was it for on Cybertron???Transforming into something super fast on land (Autobots) or in the air (Decepticons), or even aquatic is great and all, but where do these Cybertron vehicle-modes come from? Dinobots and Maximals got their animal-modes by scanning real animals, but what about Sharkticons? Did they scan alien sharks, or were they just... pre-programmed like that?Guess well have to wait and see. If its relevant to the plot, theyll tell us. If not, well, maybe they wont!",2

"Virtually a shot by shot remake. The dance bit was set outside rather than inside. Shame, wouldnt have minded the director (good director who has some good films) bringing his own spin to it. Also looks a bit dumb downed. The bit with the young lad was apparent in the original to anyone paying attention. here they are spelling it out and spoiling too much in the trailer. Wouldnt mind the ending of the original changing though. I though that was a bit weak.",1
